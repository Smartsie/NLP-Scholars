                  The stringent fuel economy and emission standards enforce sport sedan and sport utility vehicle employ four-wheel-drive (4WD) hybrid powertrain to achieve better fuel economy and acceleration performance simultaneously. This paper reviews and conducts a comparative study of four 4WD hybrid configuration types: series, series-parallel, power-split and compound-split configurations. To make a fair comparison of fuel economy and acceleration performance, an integrated hierarchical optimization framework is presented, which solves the parameters sizing and energy management problem simultaneously. The pareto-front optimal design of each configuration is derived. According to detailed energy analysis, a novel multi-mode configuration is proposed by adding clutches between planetary gear nodes of compound-split configuration. By combining multiple modes, the proposed configuration achieves better fuel-saving and acceleration performance than initial configuration. Moreover, this comparative study takes into consideration the cost, control complexity and off-road performance. The results show that the power-split one adopting three motor/generators (MGs) shows superior fuel economy and acceleration performance than others, while the proposed multi-mode configuration maintains a competing performance with less MGs. In addition, the series-parallel configuration has great comprehensive potential.

                  Since the first commercial application of hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) powertrains, power-split architectures have been a major option for construction of HEV powertrains. Are power-split HEV powertrains the best solution to all design-objective settings, or will other design schemes arise that better fit the design requirements? To generalize the system optimization to different types of HEV powertrains, representation and generation methods for generic architectures of HEV powertrain are developed, which completely clarify the available design domain of the HEV powertrain architecture. Then, an integrated multi-objective optimization that simultaneously optimizes the architecture, component parameters, and control strategy is engineered to obtain the Pareto optimal design schemes of HEV powertrains in various situations of trade-off between acceleration capacity and fuel economy. The results suggest that the power-split HEV powertrain is superior in fuel economy and the HEV powertrain adopting the architecture with torque coupling among the engine and motor/generators (1-1 type) is superior in acceleration capacity. However, the achievable optimal fuel economies of power-split and 1-1 type HEV powertrains are almost the same, whereas the trade-off ranges of power-split HEV powertrains are narrower than those of the 1-1 type architecture HEV powertrains. Conceptually, the results reflect that when design methods are restricted to a specific subspace of the design domain, due to the limited consideration of variation in HEV powertrain architectures, the theoretical optimality of the design is not guaranteed. Practically, 1-1 type architecture can be more adaptive to different trade-offs among design objectives. For variations in design objectives, the appropriate HEV powertrain can be constructed by modifying in component parameters of the 1-1 No. 5 architecture HEV powertrain rather than reconstruction of the powertrain with architectural modifications.

                  This paper presents a real-time optimization strategy that targets on short-term energy consumption for the power-split hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) by focusing the mechanical motion of the powertrains. Instead of long-term energy optimization, which is usually investigated in the literatures on state of charge (SoC) management problem of HEVs, a short-term behavior of energy consumption is focused under the assumption that SoC of the battery is enough to provide the electric power required by the optimization. To this end, the transient mechanical motion of the powertrain is considered in the optimization problem instead of the battery SoC. The proposed strategy consists of two layers: the prediction of driver’s power demand based on the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication and the optimization of energy consumption along the predicted power demand. To deal with the stochastic uncertainties in the driver’s power demand, Gaussian process regression model is developed for the prediction, and the optimization is formulated as a model predictive control problem with the mechanical model of the powertrain dynamics forced by the predicted driver’s demand. Finally, the simulation results are demonstrated where the driver’s demand is generated by a professional simulator under randomly eliminated traffic environment.

Apart from the energy management, the configuration of hybrid powertrains plays a central role in achieving better fuel economy and enhanced drivability. This paper comparatively summarizes the configurations, modeling, and optimization techniques of HEVs. Four types of hybrid powertrain configurations available in the market, i.e., series, parallel, power-split and multi-mode, are introduced firstly, followed by their state-of-the-art and pros/cons. Among all configurations, multi-mode hybrid powertrains are observed to have the potential for utilizing the benefits of the other three types by switching the operating modes. Subsequently, the configuration generation and modeling techniques are summarized. By adopting the automated modeling method, the entire design space can be explored exhaustively, and 14 feasible configuration types are classified based on the binary tree. Finally, the research gaps and future trends of HEV configuration studies are discussed.

In the proposed method, two different adjacency matrices are established to generate all powertrain configurations, and a corresponding matrix analysis method is proposed to analyze their working modes. Subsequently, a set of working modes are established to improve the efficiency of obtaining mathematical models of powertrain configurations. Finally, an energy management strategy based on dynamic programming is developed to analyze the performance of the generated configurations. The proposed method is utilized to analyze the single motor hybrid vehicle with a planetary gear and a continuously variable transmission, and a new configuration is obtained after the analysis for validation.

                  After the diesel emissions scandal, also known as Dieselgate, Direct Injection Spark-Ignited (DISI) internal combustion engines (ICE) appears as the most promising alternative to mitigate the harmful tailpipe emissions from passenger cars. In spite of that, the current ICE technologies are not enough to achieve the fuel consumption/CO2 emissions targets set by the new transportation legislation (4.1 Lgasoline/100 km, 95 gCO2/km for 2021). In this complex scenario, the electrification of the powertrain using high efficiency electric motors and battery package together with sophisticated DISI engines appears as potential solution to meet these requirements. The aim of this work is to study the fuel consumption and pollutant emissions in transient conditions from a passenger car equipped with a variable compression ratio (VCR) DISI engine and electrified powertrain technologies. The vehicle behavior was simulated by means of a 0D GT-Suite model fed by experimental results obtained in an engine test bench. Mild hybrid electric vehicle (MHEV) and full hybrid electric vehicle (FHEV) architectures using a VCR DISI engine were studied. Moreover, an optimization methodology is presented to select the best vehicle configuration in terms of hardware and control strategies by means of a design of experiments (DoE). The results show that VCR allows a fuel improvement of 3% with respect to the conventional DISI fixed CR along the worldwide harmonized light vehicles test cycles (WLTC). The benefits found when combining the VCR technology with hybrid powertrains are even higher. In this sense, the fuel improvements were higher as the electrification levels increased, with 8% for MHEV-VCR and around 20% for FHEV-VCR. In terms of emissions, the two clear benefits with FHEV-VCR were the reduction of particle number (PN) and unburned hydrocarbons (HC) of around 60% and 15%, respectively, as compared to the conventional DISI.

                  The European commission is targeting a 15% reduction in CO2 emissions for medium and heavy-duty transportation starting in 2025. Moreover, the next European normative (EU VII) will impose a decrease of 50% for NOx and particulate matter emissions with respect to the current EUVI normative. Meeting these requirements pose a significant challenge to truck and bus manufacturers. Several proposals appeared in the last few years as improve the cabin aerodynamics, decrease the friction losses and improve the powertrain efficiency. The last point involves improving the current combustion systems as well as the transmission and energy management. This work proposes to couple two potential technologies to reduce at the same time the global (CO2) and local pollution (NOx and soot). For this, two truck platforms representative of medium-duty applications (18 ton and 25 ton) are tested using the reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) combustion mode with diesel and gasoline as fuels. In addition, the trucks are electrified to full hybrid technology in a parallel pre-transmission (P2) architecture. A 0D vehicle numerical model is used to evaluate the trucks under four different driving cycles representative of homologation and real driving conditions. The numerical model is validated against on road measurements. The RCCI combustion is modeled by means of a map-based approach with 54 points measured in steady-state conditions. This work presents a complete engine map calibration with measurements up to 350 hp using two combustion modes inside the map (so-called dual-mode dual-fuel). As a baseline, the commercial diesel no-hybrid trucks and the dual-fuel no-hybrid trucks are used. The results show the potential of the dual-mode dual-fuel combustion to achieve ultra-low NOx and soot emissions. In addition, the CO2 target reduction is achieved for several truck platforms and driving conditions due to the hybridization of the driveline. The cycles with large phases of urban driving are the most favorable due to the ability of recovering energy by means of the regenerative braking system and the possibility to avoid large idling phases with respect to the no-hybrid versions. In addition, the decrease of the payload improves the CO2 reduction with respect to the baseline cases.

                  Hybrid powertrain technology must be applied to sport utility vehicles (SUVs) to meet stringent fuel economy and emissions standards. As an essential attribute of SUV, four-wheel-drive (4WD) offers flexible torque arrangement and results in safe and powerful driving under off-road conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel compound 4WD hybrid powertrain by adding an extra output shaft to a conventional power-split hybrid electric vehicle. By connecting two output shafts to the front and rear axles, this hybrid powertrain could deliver the engine power to four wheels simultaneously, while maintaining the electrical continuously variable transmission (ECVT) function. The dynamics, modeling and system characteristics of the compound 4WD hybrid powertrain are presented firstly. Using an integrated optimization framework to optimize components’ sizes, the proposed 4WD hybrid powertrain indicates 36.22% and 13.82% fuel economy improvements than conventional 4WD SUV in city and highway cycles, respectively. Since it is difficult to implement the DP in real-time controller, we present an adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (A-ECMS), whose equivalent factor (EF) is constrained by its theoretical extremum. Finally, simulation results show A-ECMS achieves better fuel economy than regular ECMS.

With six wheels driven by in-wheel motors and two driven by an AMT, the 8 × 8 vehicle has enormous potential to improve its dynamic performance, fuel economy, off-road mobility, maneuverability, gradeability, etc. On the other hand, as vehicle motion dynamics and powertrain components are closely coupled in the complex hybrid system, appropriate control strategy is urgently desired to deal with the torque distribution problem. Continuous control variables such as wheel torque, engine torque, generator torque, and discrete variable like transmission gear should be determined properly to achieve optimum control of the vehicle. A hierarchical control strategy constructed by tracking controller and allocation algorithm is proposed. Integral sliding mode control is adopted in the upper layer to track desired vehicle planar motion. The allocation problem is handled by a three-step control allocation algorithm based on quadratic programming, with carefully consideration of vehicle and powertrain features. Co-simulations with Matlab/Simulink® and TruckSim® show that the proposed coordinated control approach is capable of controlling vehicle planar motion and managing the complex series-parallel hybrid system simultaneously.

                  Recent investigations demonstrated that the real-world driving conditions differ from those proposed in the homologation cycles. This provokes that the emissions levels in real-life conditions exceed the normative values, as shown in the recent scandal related to the NOx emissions from the passenger cars equipped with diesel engines. On the other hand, the upcoming emissions regulations will limit the CO2 emissions to very low levels, which demands a further optimization of the existing technology. One way to reduce the NOx and CO2 emissions is by electrifying the powertrain in a certain degree. The objective of this work is to evaluate the potential of implementing a parallel (P2) hybrid architecture in a compact car (class C) equipped with a diesel 1.6 Euro 6d-temp engine to reduce the emissions and fuel consumption in homologation and real-life driving cycles. This has been done using a 0D numerical vehicle model and the experimental engine maps of fuel consumption and emissions measured at steady state conditions. After that, the transient conditions were simulated in homologation cycles and real-life driving cycles measured by the authors in Spain. The numerical model was validated against experimental tests carried out in an active engine test bench, evidencing differences below 4% under the worldwide harmonized light vehicles test cycle (WLTC). In the real-life cycles, the hybridization of the powertrains improves the fuel consumption for all types of driving cycles (urban, combined and highway). The major benefits are obtained in urban driving cycles, with gains up to 50% in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. In addition, the improvements in real-life conditions are higher than in the urban phase of the homologation cycles. On the contrary, combined real-life cycles (urban + rural + highway) show lower benefits than the homologation cycle. This is due to different energy management strategy that needs to be adapted to each driving situation. Lastly, it was found that, contrarily to the case of the homologation cycle, the NOx emissions are not reduced with the hybridization of the diesel powertrain in real-life conditions. Thus, to achieve 2021 CO2 target (95 g/km) and to reduce aftertreatment systems in diesel engines, other vehicles technologies need to be added to the full hybridization.

                  This article presents an optimized series-parallel hybrid powertrain transformed from a conventional vehicle using an analytical approach without changing the original chassis. The proposed approach is based on a many-objective hybrid powertrain model, which aims to optimize the vehicle weight, fuel consumptions, emissions, and performances. Three different Surrogate Assisted Evolutionary Algorithms (SAEAs) are introduced based on the improved Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA III), Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) and Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) for optimization of powertrain components. Initially, the powertrain optimization is performed for Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) driving cycle with 20% road grade. Thereafter, all the obtained Pareto solutions are combined, screened, and 78 best feasible design points are considered depending on the constraints imposed.

                  This paper presents a Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) system model for locomotives, implemented ad hoc in MATLAB-Simulink environment for a standard drive cycle; the system is hybrid and the energy store system (ESS) is composed of battery and supercapacitor (SC). The PEMFC is the primary energy source of the hybrid locomotive; it supplies the total energy demand. A battery supplies the additional energy demand in acceleration and the SC delivers the power to fill the peaks. Moreover, a regenerative brake recuperates part of the energy lost in deceleration and stores it in the ESS. The hybrid locomotive is controlled by a hybrid strategy, fit for the purpose, composed of Fuzzy Logic Control and Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy; the PEMFC power is obtained through an optimization problem and the other variables are calculated by means of IF-THEN rules in order to achieve best results from each energy source, high efficiency and low hydrogen consumption. The simulation results confirm the good response of the hybrid system model: the FC system achieves efficiency of around 50% with a hydrogen consumption of 1.3 kg; the battery State of Charge (SOC) is kept between 60% and 75% and the SC SOC between 30% and 90%.

                  Petroleum based fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced using hybrid applications in the automotive sector in the last decades. Parallel hybrid construction, which is equipped with internal combustion engine and electric motor, for the propulsion of vehicle is one of the most preferred alternatives for hybridization. The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes in the fuel consumption and exhaust emissions in the powertrain components for a parallel hybrid with torque coupling unit for different values of gear ratios. Investigation of the effects of gear ratios on the torque coupling unit, gearbox unit, and differential is performed by simulating the parallel hybrid powertrain in the MATLAB® and Simulink® environment. New European Drive Cycle speed and acceleration requirements are defined as the input parameters for this simulation. The fuel consumption, exhaust emission, and state of charge of the battery are determined according to the power requirement of internal combustion engine and electric motor. Five different gear ratio combinations are simulated. These combinations are arranged by using alternative ratios in the third stage of gearbox unit, torque coupling unit, and differential. The best gear ratio distribution among these combinations are determined for reducing the fuel consumption and the carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. It is found that an improvement of 17% in the fuel consumption and reductions of 9.1% in the CO2, 18% in the CO, 4% in the HC, and 8% in the NOx emissions can be achieved by the proper arrangements of gear ratios in the powertrain components.

Because of multiple power components (internal combustion engine, two electric machines, and a driveshaft to the wheels), configurations of such vehicular powertrains are typically very complicated. In order to systematically analyze and design a fuel-optimal powertrain, an innovative hierarchical topological graph approach is proposed. This method comprises four major design processes: (1) modeling of hybrid vehicle powertrain systems, (2) generation of a configuration pool, (3) identification of isomorphism, and (4) classification of configuration modes. Potential power-split hybrid vehicle designs are rigorously examined via a dynamic programming algorithm to estimate their acceleration performance (0–100 km/h) and fuel economy in various driving cycles.

A two-dimensional (2D) dynamic programing (DP) algorithm was designed to minimize energy consumption and system degradation. A real-time energy management strategy based on a 2D Pontryagin's Minimal Principle (2DPMP) was then proposed. Simulation results indicated that the proposed 2DPMP strategy can approximate the optimal strategy of dynamic programming well and showed a reduction in energy consumption and an increase in durability over other strategies. Component parameters and energy management strategy were simultaneously optimized based on the 2DPMP strategy, thus providing a set of optimal powertrain parameters on a Pareto front.

First, the sizing of the various powertrain components is performed adopting a simplified calculation based on a rule-based model. Then, the energy performances are evaluated through simulation over different driving cycles carried out with a self-developed Matlab/Simulink® simulator tool based on a forward-looking approach, that implements a control strategy that targets the instant velocity specified by the driving cycle. We show that when the optimal control strategy based on the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle is adopted, the fuel consumption significantly reduces with respect to the simplified rule-based control strategy approach. Finally, the overall specific energy consumption and the corresponding greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions are evaluated by means of a well-to-wheel analysis, considering various possible scenarios, covering the main traditional and low emission solutions for production, transportation and distribution of diesel, electricity and hydrogen. As expected, the highest GHG emissions are obtained in case of fossil origin of the energy carrier, with maximum value of 270 gCO

                  In this paper we present a mixed-integer linear program to represent the decision-making process for heterogeneous fleets selecting vehicles and allocating them on freight delivery routes to minimize total cost of ownership. This formulation is implemented to project alternative powertrain technology adoption and utilization trends for a set of line-haul fleets operating on a regional network. Alternative powertrain technologies include compressed (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) engines, hybrid electric diesel, battery electric (BE), and hydrogen fuel cell (HFC). Future policies, economic factors, and availability of fueling and charging infrastructure are input assumptions to the proposed modeling framework. Powertrain technology adoption, vehicle utilization, and resulting CO2 emissions predictions for a hypothetical, representative regional highway network are illustrated. A design of experiments (DOE) is used to quantify sensitivity of adoption outcomes to variation in vehicle performance parameters, fuel costs, economic incentives, and fueling and charging infrastructure considerations. Three mixed-adoption scenarios, including BE, HFC, and CNG vehicle market penetration, are identified by the DOE study that demonstrate the potential to reduce cumulative CO2 emissions by more than 25% throughout the period of study.

                  Hybrid electric vehicles are widely accepted as a promising short to mid-term technical solution due to noticeably improved efficiency and lower emissions at competitive costs. In recent years, various hybrid powertrain systems were proposed and implemented based on different types of conventional transmission. Power-split system, including Toyota Hybrid System and Ford Hybrid System, are well-known examples. However, their relatively low torque capacity, and the drive of alternative and more advanced designs encouraged other innovative hybrid system designs. In this work, a new type of hybrid powertrain system based hybridized automated manual transmission (HAMT) is proposed. By using the concept of torque gap filler (TGF), this new hybrid powertrain type has the potential to overcome issue of torque gap during gearshift. The HAMT design (patent pending) is described in details, from gear layout and design of gear ratios (EV mode and HEV mode) to torque paths at different gears. As an analytical tool, mutli-body model of vehicle equipped with this HAMT was built to analyze powertrain dynamics at various steady and transient modes. A gearshift was decomposed and analyzed based basic modes. Furthermore, a Simulink-SimDriveline hybrid vehicle model was built for the new transmission, driveline and vehicle modular. Control strategy has also been built to harmonically coordinate different powertrain components to realize TGF function. A vehicle launch simulation test has been completed under 30% of accelerator pedal position to reveal details during gearshift. Simulation results showed that this HAMT can eliminate most torque gap that has been persistent issue of traditional AMT, improving both drivability and performance. This work demonstrated a new type of transmission that features high torque capacity, high efficiency and improved drivability.

                  This study provides an optimal selection methodology for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) powertrain configuration by means of optimization and comprehensive evaluation of powertrain design schemes. The challenge of this study is to reveal each powertrain configuration performance potential in different situations of object trade-off and solve the control-physical integrated optimization problem of the PHEV powertrain design. To determine performance potential, a configuration-sizing-control strategy integrated multi-objective powertrain optimization design is proposed and applied to series, parallel pre-transmission (P2), output power-split, and multi-mode power-split powertrain configurations. Firstly, considering simultaneous optimization of fuel economy, electric energy consumption, and acceleration capacity, the parameters of the powertrain components and vehicle performance of each configuration are optimized based on global optimal control in different situations of object trade-off. Then, the Pareto optimal selection of powertrain configuration and its corresponding optimal component parameters are obtained by performance comparison and non-domination sorting. The results suggest that the P2 configuration and its optimal sizing can be selected when the goal is to optimize acceleration capacity, the multi-mode power-split configuration and its optimal sizing can be selected when the goal is to optimize electric energy efficiency, and the output power-split configuration and its optimal sizing can be selected when the fuel economy needs to be optimized.

                  Competition in the already highly competitive automotive industry intensified in the early 1990's. The ubiquitous internal combustion engine began to be challenged by the upstart alternatives of battery and hybrid electric vehicles, which has led to an intricate web of knowledge development. Our research aims to qualify and quantify the dynamic relationships that formed in the knowledge development of powertrains by adopting conceptual insights from evolutionary ecology. Specifically, the interdependent relationships observed in the Technological Innovation System (TIS) framework is similar to that between species such that powertrain systems can either support or inhibit the knowledge growth of one another over time. Our theoretical framework extends the economics of technical change within technologies vis-à-vis the concept of ‘positive and negative externalities’ and ‘knowledge development co-dynamics’. We use patents data extracted from Thomson Reuters' Derwent Innovations Index to measure the knowledge development in each technological field and apply the biological Lotka-Volterra (L-V) model to analyse the data across three separate time periods 1985–1996, 1997–2007, and 2008–2016. Our results show that the behaviour of the powertrain systems change over time as they have behaved as creative (or uncreative) and explorative (or exploitative). We also demonstrate that the powertrain systems go through temporal transitions where the relationship mode between them changes between amensalism, parasitism, commensalism, and symbiosis. In line with this we recommend that policy makers not only devise strategies (offensive or defensive) for each interaction modes but to also consider changing their strategies when there is transition between the modes. Furthermore, policy makers should consider the dual role of ‘creation’ and ‘destruction’ in their innovation policy mixes.

                  Energy consumption for any vehicle is described by energy balance (relationship between “energy in” and “energy out”), which consists of energy produced, energy consumed, internal losses as well as the need to overcome the inertia resistance to motion. Hybrid vehicles show big potential for further reduction in fuel consumption and exhaust gas emissions. Therefore, there is nothing strange in the fact that the hybrid cars are often identified as step on the journey to a more sustainable future. Currently, the powertrain concept allows synchronization of the operation of an ICE and an electric motor and redistribution of mechanical energy flows with the help of transmission shifts depending on the mode of operation of the hybrid powertrain (HPT).

                  This paper investigates a component-sizing method and a power-control algorithm for series-hybrid military vehicles equipped with hybrid energy storages that comprise batteries and super-capacitors. Component sizing of the powertrain is determined by the performance specification that is related to mission profiles and power-flow control methods. In order to minimize the effects of mission profiles and power-flow control methods, the linear programming (LP) technique is employed. The LP problem for minimizing the output energy from the engine under different conditions of driving cycles and capacities of the energy storage system (ESS) is solved to eliminate the effect of the power distribution. Through analyzing the effects of different power and energy ratings of the ESS, the optimal values of power and energy capacities of the ESS are determined. The design approaches are extensively verified with simulations and experimental results of a reduced-scale per-unit equivalent system of the 10-ton series-hybrid electric vehicle (SHEV).

                  Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have become increasingly popular due to their high fuel economy performance. HEVs typically fall into three categories according to their powertrain configuration, namely serial, parallel, and power-split hybrid. All these configurations use small internal combustion engines (ICEs), which can suffer from high torque fluctuations detrimental for noise, vibration and harshness performance. This paper introduces a novel architecture of hybrid electric powertrain systems (patent pending) which suppresses torque fluctuations and carries out the functionality of hybrid driving. This new hybrid architecture conceptually lies between a serial and a power-split. The new system uses an ICE and two electric machines, including one with a rotating stator, and has the functionalities of existing hybrid powertrains, including transmission, boost, regenerative braking. The paper presents a model for this new powertrain, and a unique controller implemented in MATLAB Simulink®. A specially designed ruled-based multi-state controller is included in the model to achieve control and enhance fuel economy. Results of drive cycle simulations show the systems performance including torque fluctuation suppression and great fuel economy.

                  The integration of the electric motor to the powertrain in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) presents acoustic stimuli that elicit new perceptions. The large number of spectral components, as well as the wider bandwidth of this sort of noises, pose new challenges to current noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) approaches. This paper presents a framework for enhancing the sound quality (SQ) of the hybrid electric powertrain noise perceived inside the passenger compartment. Compared with current active sound quality control (ASQC) schemes, where the SQ improvement is just an effect of the control actions, the proposed technique features an optimization stage, which enables the NVH specialist to actively implement the amplitude balance of the tones that better fits into the auditory expectations. Since Loudness, Roughness, Sharpness and Tonality are the most relevant SQ metrics for interior HEV noise, they are used as performance metrics in the concurrent optimization analysis, which, eventually, drives the control design method. Thus, multichannel active sound profiling systems that feature cross-channel compensation schemes are guided by the multi-objective optimization stage, by means of optimal sets of amplitude gain factors that can be implemented at each single sensor location, while minimizing cross-channel effects that can either degrade the original SQ condition, or even hinder the implementation of independent SQ targets. The proposed framework is verified experimentally, with realistic stationary hybrid electric powertrain noise, showing SQ enhancement for multiple locations within a scaled vehicle mock-up. The results show total success rates in excess of 90%, which indicate that the proposed method is promising, not only for the improvement of the SQ of HEV noise, but also for a variety of periodic disturbances with similar features.

                  There is a trend that automotive manufacturers are adopting high power density modules into electrified powertrain architecture. After evolving side by side over the past three decades, insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) and metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFETs) become main options in high power semiconductor market for traction and Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) or Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) systems. Improvements on extensive performance are mainly focused on the reduction of power losses and system reliability. Therefore, new advanced thermal management technologies are demanded in this area in order to match increasing thermal challenges. Power losses of Si-based semiconductor are dissipated in the form of heat, which must be transferred away from the switching junction effectively. Thermal limitation of each component is a key factor that indicates the quality of the whole module packaging process. In this paper, we evaluate the new vapour chamber design and its heat spreading performance on a SiC-based MOSFETs, the results could be used as guides in order to provide a solution to tackle with thermal imbalance incurred by switching current. The selected cases showed that Silicon carbide (SiC) based MOSFETs could operate at more uniform temperature gradient and hotspots can be eliminated by means of phase changing cooling methods. In addition, the replacement of conventional baseplate by vapour chamber could further reduce overall thermal resistance from junctions to coolant fluids.

               ","turers are adopting high power density modules into electrified powertrain architecture. After evolving side by side over the past three decades, insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) and metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFETs) become main options in high power semiconductor market for traction and Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) or Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) systems. Improvements on extensive performance are mainly focused on the reduction of power losses and system reliability. Therefore, new advanced thermal management technologies are demanded in this area in order to match increasing thermal challenges. Power losses of Si-based semiconductor are dissipated in the form of heat, which must be transferred away from the switching junction effectively. Thermal limitation of each component is a key factor that indicates the quality of the whole module packaging process.

                  Most hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) currently sold are power-split HEVs that use single, double or occasionally even multiple planetary gear (PG) sets to connect their powertrain elements. Adding PG sets can provide more design flexibility; however, it also increases system complexity and cost. This paper presents a comparative study of hybrid powertrains with different numbers of PG sets, which we term configurations. The analysis of different configuration types is investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively. In the qualitative analysis, the performances of operating modes for different configurations are compared, in terms of mode number, normalized efficiency, and maximum output torque. The quantitative approach compares the designs of different configurations; the fuel economy and acceleration performance of all superior designs are evaluated to make the comparison iconic. The results show that triple-PG hybrids do not have significant fuel economy improvement compared with double-PG hybrids, but they achieve a dramatic improvement in acceleration performance; this can be beneficial for sport utility vehicles (SUVs), light trucks, and buses. For cost consideration, it is suggested that passenger cars adopt double-PG hybrid powertrains.

                  Energy conservation is a very important task for the automotive industry. The use of hybrid electric vehicles can improve energy efficiency, thus reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions. In this research, the performance characteristics of a novel coaxial power-split hybrid powertrain for a transit bus are presented. The power sources are a combination of a compressed natural gas (CNG) engine and supercapacitors. A mathematical model for the coaxial power-split hybrid powertrain is established. Subsequently, an analysis program is developed based on Matlab and Advisor. The parameters are specified using experimental data. Afterwards, a rule-based control strategy is designed and optimized from the viewpoint of energy efficiency. Later, the system performance is evaluated using the Chinese Transit Bus City Driving Cycle and compared to a conventional powertrain. The results indicate that the proposed coaxial power-split hybrid powertrain can fulfill the requirements of the transit bus and enhance the energy efficiency dramatically. Moreover, the average energy efficiency of the supercapacitors was found to be above 97% over the entire driving cycle. Using supercapacitors as energy storage devices for the coaxial power-split hybrid powertrain can effectively recover the kinetic energy during regenerative braking and is a good solution for transit buses that require frequent acceleration and deceleration.

                  The transition to the green mobility economy has encouraged organisations to both collaborate and compete for building the environmental innovations required in vehicle powertrains. This study aims to uncover the inhibitive and supportive impacts traded between vehicle powertrains over time. Applying the technological innovation system framework and the Lotka–Volterra model, we argue that the increased or decreased collaboration growth of one powertrain system can drive supportive and inhibitive forces towards other powertrain systems. Collaboration growth is measured through joint patents extracted from the Derwent platform for the episodes of 1985–1996, 1997–2007, and 2008–2016. Our results show that powertrain systems drive supportive, and to some extent, inhibitive forces to one another, known as positive and negative externalities. Not only the attractiveness and carrying capacity of powertrain systems change with time, but also the interaction modes between them go through temporal transitions, mostly between symbiosis, neutralism, and commensalism. We observe that the biological inter-powertrain relationships emanate from the various elements shared between them over time. We, moreover, discover that the biological relationships and their temporal transitions have shaped around a situation in which the automotive industry is moving away from the dependence on non-green innovations towards more environmentally friendly innovations. We recommend policy makers to beware of the dual role of ‘creation’ and ‘destruction’ in their policy mixes, and accordingly, devise and deploy a mix of offensive and defensive environmental strategies to each of the interaction modes as well as during the transitions between them.

                  The purpose of this paper is to investigate the active damping of automotive powertrains for the suppression of gear shift related transient vibrations. Conventionally, powertrain vibration is usually suppressed passively through the application of torsional dampers in dual clutch transmissions (DCT) and torque converters in planetary automatic transmissions (AT). This paper presents an approach for active suppression of transient responses utilising only the current sensors available in the powertrain. An active control strategy for manipulating engine or electric machine output torque post gear change via a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is developed and implemented. Whilst conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) powertrains require manipulation of the engine throttle, for HEV powertrains the electric machine (EM) output torque is controlled to rapidly suppress powertrain transients. Simulations for both conventional internal combustion engine and parallel hybrid vehicles are performed to evaluate the proposed strategy. Results show that while both the conventional and hybrid powertrains are both capable of successfully suppressing undesirable transients, the EM is more successful in achieving vibration suppression.

                  Many actions have been recently carried out within European cities with the aim of reduce the negative impacts on traffic and environment caused by transport. New technologies for vehicles and traffic management are the key to lower transport emissions and the electric approach is a promising line to achieve EU's emissions reduction target for 2030 and 2050. Electric Vehicles (EVs) include vehicles with different technologies such as Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), Fuel Cell Vehicles (FCVs) or Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). BEVs operate purely on the battery power but the energy storage system remains one of the main critical elements due to vehicle autonomy, weight and charging time. FCV outperform BEV for its high autonomy and it is possible to perform a hydrogen recharge in short time but the costs remain high. Different from these last, hybrid configurations carried out through Batteries and Fuel Cell System (FCS) show advantages for both technologies. Within an Italian research project, CNR TAE Institute has been involved in a Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicle (FCHEV) development for public transportation. The hybrid vehicle provides the use of a FCS that distributes the electrical power in the connection between batteries and traction inverter via a DC/DC converter for the extension of the daily autonomy with respect to pure electric mode. This work describes the possibilities for sustainable development of public passenger transport based on hydrogen technologies presenting the development phases of the powertrain and preliminary on road tests in the context of smart cities applications.

The paper assesses topologies with different active and passive connections of a battery pack, ultracapacitor pack, or both. The comparison of the topologies needs a validated simulation tool, specific power control algorithms, and detailed knowledge about the target application. The results conclude that fuel cell powertrains buffered with a high-power battery pack yield minimum weight and size. However, minimum lifetime costs are obtained by topologies buffered with an ultracapacitor, which, on the other hand, increase weight and size.

To validate the Fuel cell-Li-ion battery-Ultracapacitor (FC-LIB-UC) hybrid powertrain and energy management strategies developed in this study, a test station powered by a 1 kW fuel cell system, a 2.8 kWh Li-ion battery pack and a 330 F/48.6 V ultracapacitor bank is designed and constructed on the basis of stand-alone module. Finally, an Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule cycle is performed on this station and the experimental results show that: (i) the power distribution of FC system is narrowest and the power distribution of UC bank is widest during a cycle, and (ii) the FC system is controlled to satisfy the slow dynamic variation in this hybrid powertrain and the output of the LIB pack and UC bank is adjusted to meet fast dynamic load requirements. As a result, the proposed FC-LIB-UC hybrid powertrain can take full advantage of three kinds of energy sources.

As a result, the proposed FC-LIB-UC hybrid powertrain can take full advantage of three kinds of energy sources.

                  The recent introduction of hybrid-electric powertrain technology has disrupted the automotive industry, causing significant powertrain design divergence. As this radical powertrain innovation matures, will hybrid vehicles dominate the future automotive market and does this represent a positive shift in the environmental impact of the industry? The answer to this question is sought within this paper. It seeks to take advantage of the position that the industry has reached, replacing previous theoretical studies with the first extensive empirical models of life cycle emissions and whole-life costing. A comprehensive snapshot of today’s hybrid market is presented, with detailed descriptions of the various hybrid powertrain architectures. Design data has been gathered for 44 hybrid passenger cars currently available in the US. The empirical data is used to explore the relative life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and whole-life costing of different hybrid powertrain architectures. Potential dominant designs are identified and their emissions are shown to be reduced. However, both the emissions and economic competitiveness of different hybrid powertrains are shown to vary significantly depending on how the vehicle is used.

                  Model predictive control is a promising approach to exploit the potentials of modern concepts and to fulfill the automotive requirements. Since, it is able to handle constrained multi-input multi-output optimal control problems. However, when it comes to implementation, the MPC computational effort may cause a concern for real-time applications. To maintain the advantage of a predictive control approach and improve its implementation speed, we can solve the problem parametrically. In this paper, we design a power management strategy for a Toyota Prius plug-in hybrid powertrain (PHEV) using explicit model predictive control (eMPC) based on a new control-oriented model to improve the real-time implementation performance. By implementing the controller to a PHEV model through model and hardware-in-the-loop simulation, we get promising fuel economy as well as real-time simulation speed.

                  This paper proposes a novel hybrid genetic algorithm for the simultaneous optimization of the powertrain and control parameters in plug-in hybrid electric bus (PHEB) with trade-off between economy and dynamic performance. PHEBs are potential public transportations to alleviate energy shortages and urban environment pollution. The PHEB powertrain and control parameters significantly impact the vehicle performance and economy, and an optimization process is needed to design a set of optimized parameters for a given driving route. A novel hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) which combines an enhanced genetic algorithm (EGA) with simulated annealing (SA) is proposed in this paper. By merging EGA with SA, simulated annealing process is applied to the better half population after EGA operations, and then an adaptive cooling schedule is introduced. In addition, several techniques are implemented to achieve the goals of sustaining the convergence capacity and maintaining diversity in the population, such as orthogonal design method, adaptive mechanisms of crossover and mutation probabilities. A solution relative error distance is defined to express the performance of standard genetic algorithm (SGA), EGA, and HGA. The optimization is performed over the following two driving cycles: (1) a driving cycle CYC_873 collected from a real bus route; and (2) Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule+China Typical Urban Driving Cycle (UDDS+CTUDC). Simulation results indicate that the convergence speed and global searching ability of HGA are significantly better for optimal PHEB powertrain and control parameters design. And the optimal parameters might obtain the best comprehensive performance of PHEB for the given Chinese urban driving cycles.

                  This study deals with the control of a hybrid vehicle powertrain, composed of three actuators (one engine, two electric machines). This powertrain belongs to the Electric-Infinitely Variable Transmission (E-IVT) class. In order to achieve low fuel consumption, drivability and electric power management, controllers have to achieve simultaneously three specifications, namely engine speed, wheel-torque and battery power references. Decoupled controlled-output behaviors and optimal performances are also required.
                  In order to imitate a classical powertrain, the control structure is split in two parts. The interest is to decouple transmission speed ratio control and wheel torque control. A model-based design approach is proposed, that directly deals with robustness and decoupling, in a full multivariable and frequency-dependent framework (H

                  Closed-loop simulations are presented. Stability and performances subject to disturbances and non-linearities are also evaluated, using the theory of linear parameter varying (LPV) systems.

                  The concept of passive hybrid, i.e. the direct electrical coupling between a fuel cell system and a battery without using a power converter, is presented as a feasible solution for powertrain applications. As there are no DC/DC converters, the passive hybrid is a cheap and simple solution and the power losses in the electronic hardware are eliminated. In such a powertrain topology where the two devices always have the same voltage, the active power sharing between the two energy sources can not be done in the conventional way. As an alternative, control of the fuel cell power by adjusting its operating pressure is elaborated. Only pure H2/O2 fuel cell systems are considered in this approach. Simulation and hardware in the loop (HIL) results for the powertrain show that this hybrid power source is able to satisfy the power demand of an electric vehicle while sustaining the battery state of charge.

The proposed hybrid fuel cell powertrain combines a fuel cell and two secondary battery packs with enough power but minimal in size and weight for the wheelchair. The fuel cell unit is responsible only for charging one of the battery packs, while the other battery by turns supplies power to load. This energy management strategy improves the power fluctuation of the fuel cell as well as reduces the charge frequency of the secondary battery. The effectiveness of the proposed powertrain is evaluated and compared with a traditional hybrid fuel cell powertrain with simulations and experiments, which prove that the output power of the fuel cell is nearly constant and the number of charges is reduced by 98%.

                  The proposed supervisory control system (SCS) uses a control map to maximize the powertrain efficiency of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) in real-time. The paper presents the methodology and structure of the control, including a novel, comprehensive and unified expression for the overall powertrain efficiency that considers the engine-generator set and the battery in depth as well as the power electronics. A control map is then produced with instructions for the optimal power share between the engine branch and battery branch of the vehicle such that the powertrain efficiency is maximized. This map is computed off-line and can thereafter be operated in real-time at very low computational cost. A charge sustaining factor is also developed and introduced to ensure the SCS operates the vehicle within desired SOC bounds. This SCS is then tested and benchmarked against two conventional control strategies in a high-fidelity vehicle model, representing a series HEV. Extensive simulation results are presented for repeated cycles of a diverse range of standard driving cycles, showing significant improvements in fuel economy (up to 20%) and less aggressive use of the battery.

By giving vehicle performance of gradability, maximal speeds in hybrid and pure electric modes, the power sources of the 210 kg target vehicle are: a 125 cc engine and two 1.8 kW motor and generator. The optimal tank-to-wheel efficiencies, ratios of circulating power, and operation points at specific vehicle speeds and out loads are calculated. Simulation results show that the dual-motor electric vehicle mode offers superior performance regarding electric drive; the low capacity of the battery is conducive to reducing manufacturing and maintenance costs; the tank-to-wheel efficiency is mainly operated above 20% while the power split electronic-continuously-variable-transmission mode is the major operation mode, and a maximum of 17% fuel economy improvement is achieved compared with the Toyota Hybrid System in most of the vehicle speed ranges. The outstanding performance warrants further real-system development, especially regarding the implementation in plug-in and sport hybrid powertrain designs.

This work focuses on the minimization of the lifecycle cost of a PEMFC hybrid electric propulsion system through the joint powertrain system design and control optimizations. The approach models and predicts the cost of hydrogen fuel determined by the energy efficiency of the powertrain, as well as the costs associated with the performance degradation and life-shortening of the PEMFC and the battery under a given vehicle operation profile.

                  This paper presents a case of persistent harmonic active control for an HEV (Hybrid Electric Vehicle) powertrain. The active control is adapted for a hybrid powertrain consisting of a one-cylinder diesel engine, coupled with a PMSM (Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine). The PMSM assures the propulsion of the vehicle, as in conventional mild-hybrid electrical vehicles. In addition, it provides speed ripple reductions of the diesel engine. Due to the HEV speed variation, the active control must match this variation. The speed is introduced as a parameter in order to devise an LPV (linear parameter varying) control strategy. The suitability of LPV control for engine torque ripple reduction is demonstrated through a torque control implementation of the PMSM. The control strategy uses the internal model principle of multi-sinusoidal persistent disturbances. The controller is designed to involve several steps, including LMI-based (Linear Matrix Inequalities) optimization. The results show that, for the first and second orders of the ripple, speed oscillations can be reduced when the speed varies. An industrial test bed is used to validate the effectiveness of the approach and the power consumption of the strategy is analyzed.

For achieving rule-based control, the torque distribution among the engine, motor, and generator was designed according to performance maps of power sources. To conduct power allocation of three sources, two power-split ratios were obtained. Furthermore, for switching between three operation modes (hybrid, electric vehicle, and range extension modes), two hysteresis zones based on the required power and battery state-of-charge were used with four designed variables (boundaries). A global search method was used for the optimization. A cost function with a physical-constraint penalty was used to maximize the travel distance. A simulation performed using nested-structure for-loop programs showed that the mileage extension (energy improvement) for the optimal energy management and integrated optimal energy management/mode switch timing relative to the mileage in rule-based control for two driving cycles, NEDC and FTP-75, were [26.32%, 30.52%] and [17.22%, 20.68%], respectively. The improvements of CO2 reduction were [26.34%, 27.10%] and [23.47%, 24.12%], respectively, thus proving that this study significantly reduced energy consumption and pollutant emission by employing an easily designed control strategy. Online parameter tuning and implementation of optimal energy management in a real vehicle will be conducted in the future.

                  Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition combustion technology potentials are well known for the capability to drastically reduce the engine-out nitrogen oxides and soot emissions simultaneously. Its implementation in mid-term low-duty diesel engines can be beneficial to meet the upcoming regulations. To explore the potential of this solution, experimental data are used from a compression ignition 1.9 L engine, which is operated under two combustion-modes: Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition and conventional diesel combustion. Meanwhile, also the carbon dioxide emissions limitations must be fulfilled. To achieve this goal, the benefits associated to powertrain electrification in terms of fuel economy, can be joined with the benefits of RCCI combustion. To do so, two different supervisory control strategies are compared: Adaptive Equivalent Minimization Control Strategy and Rule-Based Control strategy, while dynamic programming is used to size the electric grid of the powertrain to provide the best optimal solution in terms of fuel economy and emissions abatement. The analysis of the designed hybrid powertrain is carried out numerically with GT-Suite and Matlab-Simulink software. The results show a great potential of the parallel full-hybrid electric vehicle powertrain equipped with the dual-mode engine to reduce the engine-out emissions, also to increase fuel economy with respect to the homologation fuel consumption of the baseline vehicle. The optimal supervisory control strategy was found to be the emissions-oriented Adaptive Equivalent Minimization Control Strategy, which scores a simultaneous reduction of 12% in fuel consumption, 75% in engine-out nitrogen oxides emissions and 82% in engine-out soot, with respect to the baseline conventional diesel combustion engine vehicle.

In the no-load mode, the power consumption of the proposed system was approximately 33.3% lower than that of the traditional system. During the idle mode, the proposed system consumed no energy, while the traditional system consumed about 0.6 kW.

                  This paper presents a powertrain control strategy for a series hybrid electric vehicle (SHEV) based on the integrated design of an active charging scenario and fixed-boundary-layer sliding mode controllers (FBLSMCs). An optimized charging curve for the battery is predetermined rather than subject to engine output and vehicle power demand, which is a total inverse of normal SHEV powertrain control process. This is aimed to remove surge and high-frequency charge current, keep the battery staying in a high state-of-charge (SOC) region and avoid persistently-high charge power, which are positive factors to battery lifetime extension. Then two robust chattering-free FBLSMCs are designed to locate the engine operation in the optimal efficiency area. One is in charge of engine speed control, and the other is for engine/generator torque control. Consequently, not only fuel economy is improved but also battery life expectancy could be extended. Finally, simulation and experimental results confirm the validity and application feasibility of the proposed strategy.

                  Optimal control methods are being employed to solve the energy management problem between the energy convertors of hybrid automotive power trains. The focus thereby was on application or extensions of Pontryagin minimum principle and/or Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman theory This paper approaches it as a trajectory optimization problem relying on predictive information within a limited time horizon and solves it by applying direct optimal control in a simultaneous discretization framework.
                  In case of a parallel hybrid configuration, the energy consumption minimization problem reduces to determining engine on/off state and torque split between the combustion engine and the electric machine. A primal active set method together with heuristics on value function iterates is implemented to solve the mixed boolean convex problem. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated in case of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle with a 2 cylinder combustion engine and electric machine in parallel configuration.

                  In case of a parallel hybrid configuration, the energy consumption minimization problem reduces to determining engine on/off state and torque split between the combustion engine and the electric machine. A primal active set method together with heuristics on value function iterates is implemented to solve the mixed boolean convex problem. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated in case of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle with a 2 cylinder combustion engine and electric machine in parallel configuration.

                  This paper describes the mathematical modelling, analysis and simulation of a novel hybrid powertrain used in a scooter. The primary feature of the proposed hybrid powertrain is the use of a split power-system that consists of a one-degree-of-freedom (dof) planetary gear-train (PGT) and a two-dof PGT to combine the power of two sources, a gasoline engine and an electric motor. Detailed component level models for the hybrid electric scooter are established using the Matlab/Simulink environment. A simple rule-based power control strategy is then established with the primary objective to optimize the fuel economy of the hybrid electric scooter. The performance of the proposed hybrid powertrain is studied using the developed model under four driving cycles. The simulation results verify the operational capabilities of the proposed hybrid system and show both the engine and the electric motor work in an optimal state under various operating conditions.

                  Despite the growing share of hybrid vehicles in worldwide vehicle fleet, the impact of battery/engine switch on secondary pollutant precursors formation remains poorly understood. We herein identify the species to be removed primarily from the exhaust of hybrid vehicles to minimize secondary pollutants formation. Pollutants from a conventional (thermal) and a hybrid vehicle are herein evaluated in a chassis dynamometer bench by using two widely used driving cycles, WLTC and FTP75. Hybrid vehicle exhibits the lowest regulated emissions during all the different tests, except for NOx. The results reveal that low and cold start phases of the cycles contribute mainly to the ozone potential, although methane, butadiene and formaldehyde can be emitted at the tailpipe all along the driving cycle. We evidence for the first time a significant contribution of gas-phase reactions to butadiene and methane production inside the exhaust pipe, especially during warm restarts and accelerations. This study indicates that pollutant traps should target primarily monoaromatics which contribute typically to 40% of photochemical ozone creation and 50% to Secondary Organic Aerosols (SOA). However, the contribution of alkanes to ozone differs markedly for the hybrid vehicle, reflecting a different share of ozone production paths with respect to conventional vehicles.

                  Dry clutches have been gaining its popularity for use in the transmission systems of small and medium-sized vehicles as well as the engine clutch systems of parallel hybrid vehicles. With this trend, the ability to appropriately control the amount of torque transferred through the dry clutch becomes important. This paper addresses a feedforward control method of clutch torque during slip engagement of a dry clutch utilizing a clutch friction model. In many studies, the clutch friction coefficient is considered as the only uncertain parameter in the clutch friction model. However, the clutch touch point can also serve as a major source of uncertainty in the clutch friction model. Thus, this paper proposes a simultaneous adaptation method to estimate the clutch friction coefficient and the clutch touch point in real time and a feedforward control method of clutch torque during slip engagement of a dry clutch based on the proposed adaptation algorithm. This control approach is applied to the slip engagement control of a dry engine clutch in a parallel hybrid vehicle and its effect is experimentally verified using a production vehicle.

                  With the advantages of no emission and low noise, battery rail vehicles (BRVs) are widely used in the construction of subway, high-speed railway and so on. However, the problems of low energy efficiency and peak power shock of traction motor have severely restricted the application and promotion of BRVs. To address these problems, an electric-hydrostatic hydraulic hybrid powertrain (EH3) is designed in this paper. Friction braking (FB) is replaced by hydraulic regenerative braking (HRB) and the mode of recovered hydraulic energy coupled at the inlet of pump (ECIP) to assist acceleration is proposed. The energy conservation characteristics of recovery and coupling of hydraulic energy in EH3 powertrain are verified by simulation and laboratory test bench. The energy recovery efficiency of HRB is up to 50% and the new coupling modes can greatly reduce the consumption of electric power. The control strategy is designed to coordinate different working modes which are established based on the high-pressure accumulator (HPA) and the driving state parameters of BRVs. The simulation result shows that the energy consumption of the battery can be reduced by 17.32%. The EH3 powertrain has broad application prospects in realizing energy conservation, reducing peak motor power shock and improving the braking performance of BRVs.

                  This paper discussed the approach for designing an electric powertrain in saving energy while maintaining vehicle power performance and ride comfort. Usually, energy consumption can be improved by motor efficiency optimization. As an innovative layout, electric vehicle with in-wheel motor may suffer additional vibration due to the increase of unsprung weight. Thus, vehicle ride comfort, together with power performance and energy consumption, are considered in the powertrain design. The work is done on two levels. First, requirements for power performance, energy consumption and ride comfort are generated on the vehicle level. Second, the generated requirements are applied onto the in-wheel motor system, which is described by the motor torque, efficiency and weight models. Torque outputs, motor efficiency and lightweight are the corresponding requirements on the subsystem level. Then multi-objective global optimization is carried out on the subsystem level. The Pareto front indicates that lightweight and high efficiency are two conflicting objectives that cannot be compromised on the subsystem level. A constrained energy approach is proposed to determining the final optimal on the vehicle level with the goal of improving vehicle performance and energy consumption. The final solution has a lightweight ratio of 93.5% and motor efficiency of 92%.

                  The growing need for efficient vehicles has led many researchers to explore various ways to utilize waste heat from the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) to improve vehicle fuel economy. Past efforts in Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) have focused primarily on recovering waste heat from Conventional Vehicles (CV), which dissipate more than two-thirds of the fuel energy as waste heat. In general, WHR has always been considered as a secondary component to the vehicle powertrain and as a result it has had little success, particularly in light-duty vehicles. This investigation explores WHR from a broader perspective to better understand the possibilities and limits of WHR from CVs to future highly hybridized vehicles.
                  Fuel energy distribution in the ICE is used to evaluate the sources of waste heat and identify exhaust energy recovery as the most promising method for improving ICE thermal efficiency. Fundamental analysis of conventional and hybrid powertrain design is used to investigate how they impact the availability of exhaust energy from the ICE. Models and simulations of several engines and vehicles are used to validate the theory presented for effective WHR from light-duty vehicles. The analysis focuses on how available exhaust energy changes for different vehicles, how it varies with drive cycles, and how the induced back pressure from an exhaust energy recovery system affects ICE performance. The results indicate that effective WHR is difficult to achieve in light-duty conventional vehicles, but is viable in a highly hybridized vehicles, where ICE thermal efficiency can be increased by at least 15 percent over various drive cycles.

                  Hybrid electric propulsion has served as an advantageous powertrain solution for improving the performance, fuel efficiency and emissions of passenger vehicles using well-established fueling infrastructure of gasoline and diesel, and with low conversion cost. Natural gas (NG) presents as a promising alternative fuel to replace diesel for heavy-duty vehicles with prominent potentials of fuel cost and emissions reduction, but its wide adoption still faces a number of technical challenges, including weaker engine performance, and sharply increased hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions at certain engine operation states. This work introduces a new approach to integrate the NG-diesel dual-fuel compression ignited (CI) engine, hybrid electric powertrain system, and optimal powertrain control and energy management to consider vehicle performance, fuel efficiency and CO2/HC/CO/NOx emissions simultaneously to address these issues. The mining truck’s hybrid powertrain system and component models, including NG engine fuel efficiency and emission models, have been introduced to support the work. An advanced surrogate model based global optimization method is extended to solve the computational intensive, black-box optimization problem for optimal power control and energy management. Implementation of the optimization results into control rules for real-time operation, and HIL simulation results to demonstrate the benefits of the newly introduced method are presented using a case study on a representative mining truck and its operations.

The experimental setup is configured to acquire the battery current, voltage, and its inner and surface temperatures in discrete and in full-field scans. The power-split hybrid configuration is tested using a standard and artificial driving cycles. A battery resistance model is then used to couple the experimental boundary conditions with the finite differencing code, which employed a cell-based internal heat generation model to describe the pack chemical reaction mechanism.

As a result, this method is a particularly valuable tool for hybrid vehicle powertrain analysis. In the case where novel or prototype hardware is being examined, it is often necessary to scale the signals in and out of the prototype system in order to represent production-sized components. This scaling process is often done in an ad-hoc manner.

                  This article presents a real-life application for the extremal harmonic active control of power [1] applied on a hybrid engine setup. The active control was adapted for a hybrid powertrain constituted of a one-cylinder diesel engine coupled with a permanent magnet synchronous machine. The problem was formulated in the harmonic domain and the control objective was to extremalize energetic criterions. Three criterions were considered: minimizing the speed ripple of the engine, maximizing the mechanical reactive power (mechanical impedance adaptation) and maximizing the active electric power for energy harvesting. The results show that, for the first and second orders of the ripple, speed oscillations can be completely cancelled and reactive power and active power can be optimized on-line. The implicit extremal controller converged rapidly, remaining stable even when the mean engine speed changed abruptly. These results confirm the robustness and the applicability of the extremal harmonic active control for industrial applications.

A mathematical model of an electric vehicle powertrain is developed including a DC equivalent circuit model for the electric machine and multi-body dynamic model of the powertrain system is then developed and integrated with a hydraulic clutch control system model. Integral control of the powertrain is then performed through simulations on the develop powertrain system model for each of the four shift cases. These simulation results are then replicated on a full scale powertrain test rig. To evaluate the performance of results shift duration and vehicle jerk are used as metrics to demonstrate that the presented strategies are effective for shift control in electric vehicles.

                  A novel dual-motor multi-modes powertrain system for pure electric vehicle is proposed. By the control of the motor and clutch coordinately, there are four kinds of driving modes: single motor 1 drives alone, single motor 2 drives alone, dual-motor torque coupling drives and dual-motor speed coupling drives. These four driving modes are used to adapt to different driving conditions so that the efficiency of the whole vehicle can be improved and the mileage range can be extended. A parameter matching method is proposed. This method is based on the statistic analysis of the demanded power of driving cycle and restrained by the dynamic performance. It raises a mode shift strategy and a power split strategy both based on optimal efficiency. Compared with the traditional single-motor powertrain system, the energy utilization efficiency of the novel powertrain system can be improved significantly. Also the dynamic performance is improved.

                  This paper focuses on a method to control an hybrid power-split transmission. The main issue is the multivariable aspect of these systems. From a practical point of view, the control needs to track simultaneously a wheel torque, an engine speed and an electric power target. The approach proposed here is based on a two level control strategy. The first one is a so-called energy management which aims at calculating an optimal set of targets minimizing fuel consumption and deciding to stop or start the engine with a sub-optimal but reasonable method. Given these targets, the second control level aims at controlling the transmission, taking into account inertia in a multivariable way in order to achieve some good tracking and decoupling objectives. Each driving mode has to be considered and corresponds to a specific control requirement. To give more realism to previous papers on this topic, we focus here on the fuel cut-off and start modes which are described in details. To this purpose, an observer based state feedback in described. In the last section, we present simulations results for two power-split transmissions on two different driving cycles. The achieved fuel consumption and the control behavior are presented.

                  Powertrain electrification including hybridizing advanced combustion engines is a viable cost-effective solution to improve fuel economy of vehicles. This will provide opportunity for narrow-range high-efficiency combustion regimes to be able to operate and consequently improve vehicle’s fuel conversion efficiency, compared to conventional hybrid electric vehicles. Low temperature combustion (LTC) engines offer the highest peak brake thermal efficiency (BTE) reported in literature, but these engines have narrow operating ranges. In addition, LTC engines have ultra-low soot and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions, compared to conventional compression ignition and spark ignition (SI) engines. In this study, an experimentally developed multi-mode LTC-SI engine is integrated into a parallel hybrid electric configuration, where the engine operation modes include homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI), reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI), and conventional SI. The powertrain controller is designed to enable switching among different modes, with minimum fuel penalty for transient engine operations. A pontryagin’s minimum principal (PMP) methodology is used in the energy management supervisory controller to study a multi-mode LTC engine in parallel HEV architecture with various hybridization levels. The amount of torque assist by the e-motor can change the LTC mode operating time, which leads to variation in the vehicle’s fuel consumption. The results for the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) driving cycle show the maximum benefit of the multi-mode LTC-SI engine is realized in the mild electrification level, where the LTC mode operating time increases dramatically from 5.0% in a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) to 20.5% in a mild HEV.

                  Recent advances in Inter-Vehicle Communications (IVC) and Vehicle-Infrastructure Integration (VII) paved ways to real-time information sharing among vehicles, which are beneficial for vehicle energy management strategies (EMS). This is especially valuable for power-split hybrid electrical vehicles (HEV) in order to determine the optimal power-split between two different power sources at any particular time. Certainly, researches in this area have been done, but tradeoffs between optimality, driving-cycle sensitivity, speed of calculation and charge-sustaining (CS) conditions have not been cohesively addressed before. In light of this, a combined approach of a time-efficient powertrain optimization strategy, utilizing trajectory prediction based on IVC and VII is proposed. First, Gipps’ car following model for traffic prediction is used to predict the interactions between vehicles, combined with the cell-transmission-model (CTM) for the leading vehicle trajectory prediction. Secondly, a computationally efficient charge-sustaining (CS) HEV powertrain optimization strategy is analytically derived and simulated, based on the Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle and a CS-condition constraint. A 3D lookup-map, generated offline to interpolate the optimizing parameters based on the predicted speed, is also utilized to speed up the calculations. Simulations are conducted for 6-mile and 15-mile cases with different prediction update timings to test the performance of the proposed strategy against a Rule-Based (RB) control strategy. Results for accurate-prediction cases show 9.6% average fuel economy improvements in miles-per-gallon (MPG) over RB for the 6-mile case and 7% improvements for the 15-mile case. Prediction-with-error cases show smaller average MPG’s improvements, with 1.6% to 4.3% improvements for the 6-mile case and 2.6% to 3.4% improvements for the 15-mile case.

                  This paper presents a novel convex modeling approach which allows for a simultaneous optimization of battery size and energy management of a plug-in hybrid powertrain by solving a semidefinite convex problem. The studied powertrain belongs to a city bus which is driven along a perfectly known bus line with fixed charging infrastructure. The purpose of the paper is to present the convexifying methodology and validate the necessary approximations by comparing with results obtained by Dynamic Programming when using the original nonlinear, non-convex, mixed-integer models. The comparison clearly shows the importance of the gear and engine on/off decisions, and it also shows that the convex optimization and Dynamic Programming point toward similar battery size and operating cost when the same gear and engine on/off heuristics are used. The main conclusion in the paper is that due to the low computation time, the convex modeling approach enables optimization of problems with two or more state variables, e.g. allowing for thermal models of the components; or to include more sizing variables, e.g. sizing of the engine and the electric machine simultaneously.

                  Due to limited flexibility of engine operation, it is uneasy to improve the fuel economy of parallel hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) with a single electric machine (SEM) from control perspective only. However, from design perspective, it is likely to devise multiple operating modes on a powertrain system to achieve better fuel economy. Therefore, in this paper, a velocity coupling HEV system with a SEM has been proposed, which has eleven modes, including an electric vehicle (EV) mode, three regenerative braking modes, an engine-start mode, an electrically variable transmission (EVT) mode, a parallel HEV mode, an engine-only mode, and three charging modes. Dynamic Programming (DP), as a global optimization algorithm, is leveraged to minimize the fuel consumption of this system. For comparison purposes, the P1 and P2 HEV systems are also examined by DP using the same vehicular parameters. Comparative results indicate that the P2 HEV saves about 6.68% fuel consumption over the P1 HEV, while more improvement can be observed from the proposed velocity coupling HEV, with 13.82% fuel consumption reduction over the P1 HEV.

                  Gearshift optimal control of a hybrid powertrain with a lumped/decoupled transmission model and backlash dynamics in the driveline is studied. A model is used for a heavy duty powertrain including a validated mean value diesel engine model with electric generator, transmission dynamics representing the dynamics of the automated manual transmission system and driveshaft flexibilities. Backlash dynamics are also included in the driveline model by introducing a switching function. By applying numerical optimal control methods and dividing the gearshift process into separate phases, optimization problems are solved to investigate the minimum time and low Jerk gearshift transients. The controls are also calculated with fuel penalties added to the minimum Jerk optimization and the transients are analyzed.

                  This paper integrates a two-phase fuel cell stack model, previously published and validated in Tang et al. (2017) for the specific purpose of investigating freeze start behavior, into a full-hybrid fuel cell powertrain model to simulate cold start. The aim of the simulation is to provide an overview of exergy loss distribution during a cold start drive cycle scenario. Another intention is to propose a methodology for suggesting the directions in thermal management development. The powertrain model simulates an Artemis-like transient drive cycle starting from −20 °C. The heater-core bypass and fuel cell stack power threshold are selected as representative thermal/energy management options. To evaluate the impact of the selected options on the warm up, the accumulated energy consumption and exergy flow rates are analyzed. The statistics from our simulation show that the inefficient energy consumption occurs mainly in the city stage shortly after the successful freeze start. The tank-to-wheel efficiency merely achieves 10.3% in the city stage, while the fuel cell stack can reach nearly 73% exergy efficiency throughout the entire drive cycle and tank-to-wheel efficiency reaches 29.3% at the end of the whole drive cycle. The improvement is suggested to be focused in the low power demand stages by cutting down to the actual power ratio needed and simultaneously minimize the relevant thermal-hydraulic inertia. Several optimization directions such as cascaded fuel cell stack alignment, split cooling and power demand threshold for active rapid warm up are drawn. The established fuel cell powertrain model combined with exergy analysis is a suitable methodology for further detailed thermal and energy management investigations.

Noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) of a vehicle are important factors for vehicle users and essential for successful commercialization of this vehicle type. This paper is a compact state-of-the-art review of both NVH characteristics and relevant suppression methods for HEVs. The NVH-related problems are categorized into three categories: engine, powertrain, motor-related. A detailed overview of each category/problem-type is provided, the NVH-suppression methods for different types of HEVs are introduced, and their respective advantages discussed. In addition, emerging developments and ideas for future improvements are summarized. As a result, the paper should be particularly helpful for researchers, who are interested in the development of high-performance HEVs that can provide both substantially improved ride-comfort and reduced energy-consumption.

The current work uses the Advanced Vehicle Simulator (ADVISOR) to analyze the influence of the degree of hybridization (DOH) on the performance and total cost of an FCEV (Hyundai Nexo 2019 model). The costs and fuel economy results of the different configurations (different DOH) are compared to those of the original vehicle. The configuration with the highest degree of hybridization (DOH = 61.2%) showed an 8.3% increase in fuel economy and a total cost reduction of 13.2% compared to the original vehicle. In addition, the best vehicle configuration results are compared to a same-segment gasoline-internal combustion engine vehicle and the original Hyundai Nexo in different cost scenarios.

                  The development of hybrid electric two wheelers in recent years has targeted the reduction of on road emissions produced by these vehicles. However, added cost and complexity have resulted in the failure of these systems to meet consumer expectations. This paper presents a comparative study of the energy economy and essential costs of alternative forms of small two wheelers such as scooters or low capacity motorcycles. This includes conventional, hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric variants. Through simulations of vehicle driving range using two popular driving cycles it is demonstrated that there is considerable benefit in fuel economy realised by hybridising such vehicles. However, the added costs associated with electrification, i.e. motor/generator, power electronics, and energy storage provide a significant cost obstacle to the purchase of such vehicles. Only the pure electric configuration is demonstrated to be cost effective over its life in comparison to conventional two wheelers. Both the hybrid electric and plug-in equivalents must overcome significant upfront costs to be cost competitive with conventional vehicles. This is demonstrated to be achieved if the annual driving range of the vehicle is increased substantially from the assumed mean. Given the shorter distances travelled by most two wheeler drivers it can therefore be concluded that the development of similar hybrid electric vehicles are unlikely to achieve the desired acceptance that pure electric or conventional equivalents currently achieve.

                  This paper proposes a novel fuzzy controller based on an adaptive membership function for optimum power management of a fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FCHEV). In the first phase, an electric powertrain model of the FCHEV is derived and a fuzzy controller is proposed. Then, the fuzzy controller is optimized using a genetic algorithm. The optimization process is accomplished through simulation for a given driving cycle. Since, however, the optimized result may vary according to the applied driving cycle for optimization, it is impossible for one optimized result to cover various driving cycles. In the second phase, an adaptive membership function based on a stochastic approach is proposed to guarantee optimum performance from the presented fuzzy controller, even though the driving cycle changes. This controller is referred to as the ‘Stochastic fuzzy controller’ (SFC) in this study. The SFC employs a stochastic approach where membership functions can be transformed statistically using a probability evaluated from driving pattern recognition. Then, driving cycle analysis is performed through off-line simulation and hardware in a loop simulation (HILS) test for four driving cycles. Finally, the SFC shows the best performance in terms of minimum fuel consumption and state-of-charge (SoC) maintenance.

                  In the last years an increasing interest has grown about the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) for waste heat recovery from the engine exhausts, as a feasible way to improve the efficiency of internal combustion engines (ICE). However, the highly variable working conditions in which an engine usually works make the operation of the ORC unit very challenging. In the management of ORC units, optimization and control are considered as an essential step in order to attain good performance during the whole operation of the ICE on a driving cycle. In this paper a GT-Power model of a 12.6 l turbocharged Diesel engine is used as a typical heavy duty Diesel engine to retrieve the temperature and the mass flow rate of the exhaust gases during a heavy heavy-duty driving cycle. An optimization process is performed to maximize the power output of the ORC as a function of the revolution speeds of the pump and of the turbine. For powertrain electrification purposes, two different ORC layouts are proposed in this paper, both seeking to store the recovered energy into a battery pack. The first layout is optimized based on mean values of exhausts temperature and mass flow rate, while the second layout is designed to control independently the revolutions of the pump and of the turbine of the ORC unit toward optimal values for maximum net power output. Both the layouts allow to recover an interesting amount of energy, in spite of a straightforward control strategy. Nonetheless, results show that optimizing the net power of the ORC cycle by decoupling the turbine and the pump may not ensure the maximization of the recovered energy. In fact, the storable energy from the ORC unit is strongly affected by the conversion efficiencies related to the specific layout.

                  In recent years, road vehicles are being increasingly equipped with hybrid electric power-trains in order to provide significant gains in fuel economy and reductions in greenhouse gases emissions. Since hybrid power-trains consist of two or more different energy sources, many of their variants are present nowadays which leads to many open questions in terms of hybrid electric power-train structure selection, components sizing and energy management control, which all have influence on the power-train purchase cost and efficiency. The control variables optimisation is crucial in order to find the set of optimal control rules for different power-train operating regimes which would yield the minimum possible fuel consumption. Among different control variable optimisation methods, the dynamic programming approach is usually used in literature, because of its unique feature to find the global optimum solution with a certain degree of precision. However, this optimisation method also requires significant computing power and its application is limited to low-order systems. Having this in mind, this paper evaluates the benefits of innovative cascade approach to hybrid electric vehicle control variable optimisation wherein dynamic programming is combined with a gradient-based optimisation algorithm in a systematic and a straightforward way in order to significantly reduce the optimisation execution time and also to increase the precision of the globally-optimal result.

                  Hybrid off-road vehicles generally use an engine and an energy storage system (e.g., ultracapacitor) as the power sources for propulsion. By optimally splitting power demand to different actuators (i.e., electric motors), fuel economy can be improved greatly. Thus, the control strategies of hybrid vehicles play an important role in fuel savings. While many optimal control strategies have been proposed, two major concerns present themselves: the need for prior knowledge of future driving conditions and the slow computation speed. In this paper, a novel near-optimal power management strategy, called efficiency-based evaluation real time control strategy (EERCS), is developed to rapidly obtain near-optimal fuel economy. We formulate the normalized efficiency of power flow as the criterion. By maintaining high system efficiency under all conditions, the controller can obtain near-optimal fuel economy with no need for prior knowledge. To validate the control effect, the proposed novel controller is compared with dynamic programming (DP) and power-weighted efficiency analysis for rapid sizing (PEARS+). A complex multi-mode power-split hybrid track-type dozer is selected for the case study. Simulation results show that the new power management strategy produces results similar to those of DP and PEARS+ together, with a faster computation speed. Two distributed drive cycles are used to verify the robustness of EERCS. The resulting control law can also be applied online as a static mapping function of the powertrain state. The proposed novel strategy is also a promising control tool that can be extended to other types of hybrid electric vehicles.

                  This study developed an online suboptimal energy management system by using improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) for engine/motor hybrid electric vehicles. The vehicle was modeled on the basis of second-order dynamics, and featured five major segments: a battery, a spark ignition engine, a lithium battery, transmission and vehicle dynamics, and a driver model. To manage the power distribution of dual power sources, the IPSO was equipped with three inputs (rotational speed, battery state-of-charge, and demanded torque) and one output (power split ratio). Five steps were developed for IPSO: (1) initialization; (2) determination of the fitness function; (3) selection and memorization; (4) modification of position and velocity; and (5) a stopping rule. Equivalent fuel consumption by the engine and motor was used as the fitness function with five particles, and the IPSO-based vehicle control unit was completed and integrated with the vehicle simulator. To quantify the energy improvement of IPSO, a four-mode rule-based control (system ready, motor only, engine only, and hybrid modes) was designed according to the engine efficiency and rotational speed. A three-loop Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) was coded as the best case. The simulation results revealed that IPSO searches the optimal solution more efficiently than conventional PSO does. In two standard driving cycles, ECE and FTP, the improvements in the equivalent fuel consumption and energy consumption compared to baseline were (24.25%, 45.27%) and (31.85%, 56.41%), respectively, for the IPSO. The CO2 emission for all five cases (pure engine, rule-based, PSO, IPSO, ECMS) was compared. These results verify that IPSO performs outstandingly when applied to manage hybrid energy. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) implementation and a real vehicle test will be conducted in the near future.

                  Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) can be considered as a potential technology to promote the change from conventional mobility to e-mobility. However, the real benefits in terms of CO2 emissions depend on a great extent on their mode of use, vehicle design and electricity source. On the other hand, in the last few years, advanced combustion modes as Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) showed great advantages in terms of NOx and soot emissions reduction. This paper has the purpose of assessing, through numerical simulations fed with experimental results, the potential of different hybrid vehicles when used together with a low temperature combustion mode. In particular, the dual-fuel Mild (MHEV), Full (FHEV) and Plug-in (PHEV) hybrid electric vehicles are tested and compared to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and the conventional dual-fuel powertrain, both no-Hybrid vehicles. The powertrains are optimized to meet the current European homologation legislation Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP). After that, a deep analysis is performed in terms of performance and emissions. Lastly, a life-cycle analysis (LCA) is performed to evaluate the real potential of the different technologies. The results show that the PHEV has the highest benefits in terms of fuel consumption and engine-out emissions. With this technology, it is possible to achieve the 50 g/km CO2 target for the PHEVs with a medium battery size (15 kWh), while NOx and soot levels are under the Euro 6 limits. In addition, the RCCI technology shows great benefits to achieve the Euro6 soot level for the other hybrid platforms. The LCA shows that the PHEVs can achieve 12% reduction of the total CO2 with respect to the FHEVs, and 30% with respect to the no-hybrid diesel platform.

The work aims at individuating the energy flows involved in the system during different missions, proposing an intelligent combination of technical solutions which minimize fuel consumption. Through a validated Matlab–Simulink model, able to indicate the powertrain energy breakdown, simulations are carried out to evaluate the fuel saving associated to a series of powertrain management logics which lead to the minimization of engine losses, the recovery of reverse power in deceleration and braking, the elimination of useless engine cycles.

                  In order to assess the influences of different powertrain structures and energy management strategies on the performance of hybrid fuel cell buses (FCB), two buses (FCB A and FCB B) were constructed with a “energy hybrid structure” and “power hybrid structure”, respectively. Different energy management strategies were investigated based on analysis of the two systems. And the two buses were compared with each other in a bus cycle and constant speed testing. The Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) in FCB A showed an advantage in fuel economy for it worked usually in the high efficient range of the PEMFC engine. The hydrogen consumption rate in the cycle testing was 7.9kg/100km and 9.8kg/100km for FCB A and FCB B, and in the 40kmph constant speed testing it was 3.3kg/100km and 4.0kg/100km, respectively. The fuel economy could be improved when the hydrogen and air supply subsystems are optimized and controlled with an advanced algorithm. It could also benefit from a braking energy regeneration system. Compared with FCB A, the PEMFC in FCB B worked under unfavorable operation conditions because its working range was comparatively wide, and the power changing rate was relatively large from a statistical point of view, which resulted in performance recession of the PEMFC in FCB B. After a mileage of 7000km, the output power of the PEMFC in FCB B was reduced by 10%, compared with 2.4% in FCB A. An advanced energy management strategy is necessary to split the power between the PEMFC and a battery suitable for long durability of a PEMFC.

                  The second part of the paper “Hybridization of powertrain and downsizing of IC engine” presents an extensive analysis and parametric study of hybrid powertrain parameters for different drive cycles and electric energy storage devices as well as the results of vehicle dynamics. The analysis is based on the simulation model and analytical groundwork presented in Part 1. Very good agreement of the simulation and analytical results gives confidence in the accuracy of the performed analysis. Thus, the combined simulation and analytical analysis enables deep insight into the energy flow and energy loss phenomena in hybrid powertrains and reveals the advantages and disadvantages of hybrid powertrains running under different operating conditions. The analysis covers a broad range of parallel hybrid powertrain configurations spreading from mild- to full-hybrids. The aim of this paper is to indicate the influencing parameters that lead to an optimal combination of hybrid powertrain components in order to achieve an improved fuel economy of hybrid powertrains with the emphasis on drive cycle load as well as component sizes and efficiencies. It is shown in the paper that parallel hybrid powertrains exhibit considerable potential for higher energy conversion efficiency compared with conventional powertrains if their constituting components are sized adequately.

                  In this paper we present models and optimization algorithms to compute the optimal low-level control strategies for hybrid electric powertrains. Specifically, we study the minimum-fuel operation of a turbocharged internal combustion engine coupled to an electrical energy recovery system, consisting of a battery and two motors connected to the turbocharger and to the wheels, respectively. First, we combine physics-based modeling approaches with neural networks to identify a piecewise affine model of the power unit accounting for the internal dynamics of the engine, and formulate the minimum-fuel control problem for a given driving cycle. Second, we parse the control problem to a mixed-integer linear program that can be solved with off-the-shelf optimization algorithms that guarantee global optimality of the solution. Finally, we validate our model against a high fidelity nonlinear simulator and showcase the presented framework with a case-study for racing applications. Our results show that cylinder deactivation and turbocharger electrification can decrease fuel consumption up to 4% and 8%, respectively.

                  We compare the potential of hybrid, extended-range plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicles to reduce lifetime cost and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions under various scenarios and simulated driving conditions. We find that driving conditions affect economic and environmental benefits of electrified vehicles substantially: Under the urban NYC driving cycle, hybrid and plug-in vehicles can cut life cycle emissions by 60% and reduce costs up to 20% relative to conventional vehicles (CVs). In contrast, under highway test conditions (HWFET) electrified vehicles offer marginal emissions reductions at higher costs. NYC conditions with frequent stops triple life cycle emissions and increase costs of conventional vehicles by 30%, while aggressive driving (US06) reduces the all-electric range of plug-in vehicles by up to 45% compared to milder test cycles (like HWFET). Vehicle window stickers, fuel economy standards, and life cycle studies using average lab-test vehicle efficiency estimates are therefore incomplete: (1) driver heterogeneity matters, and efforts to encourage adoption of hybrid and plug-in vehicles will have greater impact if targeted to urban drivers vs. highway drivers; and (2) electrified vehicles perform better on some drive cycles than others, so non-representative tests can bias consumer perception and regulation of alternative technologies. We discuss policy implications.

                  The objective of this work is to estimate drivability characteristics parameters of two wheeler powertrain with control oriented powertrain model. The evaluation is essential for defining drivability characteristics for a future electric variable transmission (EVT) powertrain. The mathematical model for the complete powertrain is developed using suitable modeling approaches for the different sub-modules of the complete system. The Spark Ignition (SI) engine model used for this work is developed from mean value model approach and experimentally validated with test data from TVS Motor Company, India. The model is integrated with two types of transmission models, Continuous Variable Transmission (CVT) and Manual Transmission (MT). It simulates dynamic power-flow from the engine to wheel for analyzing longitudinal drivability of the vehicle for both powertrain configurations. It is proposed that the drivability can be measured with certain parameters which show good correlation with subjective assessments for vehicle launch as well as tip in condition. The objective assessment of both types of powertrains is performed using the above mentioned powertrain models. The results of the simulation for drivability tests are discussed in this paper.

                  Traditional methods have played an important role in energy saving of hydraulic excavators. However the excavators are still working with low fuel efficiency and bad exhaust. So, new technologies are urgently needed to further reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emissions. Researchers have begun to focus on hybrid technology of hydraulic excavators. This paper systematically analyzed the performance of the powertrain hybridization of hydraulic excavator and compared the main performance among the parallel, the series and the conventional configurations based on a 5-ton excavator. The data of the conventional excavator used for analysis were gathered from the real working process, while that of the hybrid configurations were got from the model simulation. The data used as the load input of the model were also gathered from the real working process. The model of the hybrid powertrains were built with the reliable lookup-table approach, which provides deep insight into the energy conversion phenomena. The presented results indicate that the parallel hybrid powertrain features better fuel economy than the other two configurations in heavy mode and light mode, whereas both the series and parallel hybrid powertrains feature better fuel economy in medium mode. Considering the performance and cost synthetically, the parallel powertrain is the best configuration for hybrid excavators at present.

                  The strong new restrictions in the vehicle CO2 emissions together with the instability of the fossil fuels reserves reinforces the necessity to continue developing high efficiency combustion engines that operate with renewable energy sources. Bio-ethanol appears as a potential fuel to replace well-established fossil fuels, such as gasoline, due to the overall carbon neutral emission. In addition, the high-octane number allows to increase the compression ratio of the engine to improve the thermal efficiency. Apart from the CO2, the emissions legislation restricts the NOx and particle matter emissions to ultra-low values, and they will continue decreasing down to almost zero. In this work, two advanced dual-fuel combustion modes using bio-ethanol as main fuel are studied. A pre-chamber ignition system (PCIS) using bio-ethanol and hydrogen, and a reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI) combustion mode operating with bio-ethanol/diesel was selected due to the potential to reduce NOx emissions. These combustion technologies were studied by a numerical 0-D vehicle simulations in homologation and real-life driving cycles for a range extender hybrid powertrain. As a baseline, the original manufacturer spark ignition (SI) no-hybrid powertrain fueled with pure bio-ethanol was used. The powertrain components and control system were optimized to obtain the maximum overall vehicle efficiency, and low CO2-NOx emissions. Finally, a life cycle analysis (LCA) was performed to study the global potential of the bio-ethanol to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A battery electric vehicle (BEV) and a gasoline SI no-hybrid vehicle were added for comparison. The results show that the RCCI mode presents the highest potential to reduce the NOx emissions. However, the PCIS allows to reduce the tank to wheel CO2 emissions up to 60 g/km when high rates of H2 are used. The LCA-GHG for the vehicles using bio-ethanol is 50% and 95% lower than a BEV and SI-gasoline vehicle, respectively.

However, the PCIS allows to reduce the tank to wheel CO2 emissions up to 60 g/km when high rates of H2 are used. The LCA-GHG for the vehicles using bio-ethanol is 50% and 95% lower than a BEV and SI-gasoline vehicle, respectively.

                  The aim of this two part paper is to present the results of extensive simulation and analytical analysis of the energy conversion efficiency in parallel hybrid powertrains. The simulation approach is based on an accurate and fast forward facing simulation model of a parallel hybrid powertrain and a conventional internal combustion engine powertrain.

Models of the electrical devices enable computation of the instantaneous energy consumption, production and storage as well as computation of the instantaneous energy losses and component efficiencies. Moreover, the paper offers an analytical approach based on the energy balance in order to analyze and predict the energy conversion efficiency of hybrid powertrains. The analysis covers a broad range of parallel hybrid powertrain configurations from mild to full hybrids. Combined simulation and analytical analysis enables deep insight into the energy conversion phenomena in hybrid powertrains. The paper reveals the conditions and influences that lead to improved fuel economy of hybrid powertrains with the emphasis on determining the optimum hybridization ratio. The theoretical background, simulation program and brief analysis of one test cycle are presented in Part 1, whereas the extensive analysis and parametric study is presented in the companion paper, Part 2.

                  The stringent regulations, increased global temperature and customer demand for high fuel economy have led to rapid developments of different alternative propulsion solutions in the last decade, with special attention to the electrified vehicles. The combination of electric machines with conventional powertrains allows to diversify the powertrain architectures. In addition, alternative combustion modes as reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) have been shown to provide simultaneous ultra-low NOx and soot emissions with similar or better thermal efficiency than conventional diesel combustion (CDC). Therefore, the combination of both technologies creates a promising horizon to be implemented in commercial vehicles of the near future. In this work, experimental and numerical simulations were combined to study the potential of the parallel full hybrid electric vehicle (P2-FHEV) and mild hybrid vehicle (MHEV) to obtain lower fuel consumption and NOx emissions than a conventional powertrain in the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Cycle (WLTC). The hybrid vehicles are simulated with both CDC and diesel-gasoline RCCI combustion engines as power source. Each powertrain was optimized in terms of components (battery, electric motors…) capacity, internal combustion engine operative points, energy management strategy and gear ratios. The results show a significant fuel consumption reduction as the complexity of the hybrid system increases. The parallel architecture, which represents the most complex hybrid system tested in this work, allows obtaining a fuel consumption reduction of around 20% as compared to CDC. The dual-mode CDC-RCCI concept showed improvements in NOx and soot emissions with comparable values in terms of energy consumption and CO2 emissions than CDC. Additionally, the mild hybrid technology with the functionality of start-stop, torque assist and regenerative braking showed an acceptable balance between complexity and fuel consumption gain.

                  The series-parallel architecture of the plug-in hybrid electric powertrain has attracted wide attentions in recent years for its flexible and highly efficient operating modes. However, despite the improvement of the vehicle fuel economy, it has been gradually facing more challenges on the design of the optimal controller due to the complex structure and the fast depletion of the battery. In this paper, a two-step optimal energy management strategy is proposed for a novel single-shaft series-parallel powertrain. In the first step, an equivalent method is adopted, in which two motors are equivalently regarded as one. After detailed analysis of the operating modes, various objective functions are established to pre-optimize the power split between engine and motor or two motors. In the second step, a stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) is adopted to optimize the power split between the engine and the equivalent motor, and the optimal combination of the operating modes. Then coupled with the pre-optimized results of the first step, the optimal power split among the engine and two motors could be obtained and then constructed as simple lookup-tables, which have great potential for practical applications. Finally, the preliminary test about the real-time performance of the optimal results is developed on the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) system.

                  Integrated motor-transmission (IMT) powertrain system with directly coupled motor and gearbox is a good choice for electric commercial vehicles (e.g., pure electric buses) due to its potential in motor size reduction and energy efficiency improvement. However, the controller design for powertrain oscillation damping becomes challenging due to the elimination of damping components. On the other hand, as controller area network (CAN) is commonly adopted in modern vehicle system, the network-induced time-varying delays that caused by bandwidth limitation will further lead to powertrain vibration or even destabilize the powertrain control system. Therefore, in this paper, a robust energy-to-peak controller is proposed for the IMT powertrain system to address the oscillation damping problem and also attenuate the external disturbance. The control law adopted here is based on a multivariable PI control, which ensures the applicability and performance of the proposed controller in engineering practice. With the linearized delay uncertainties characterized by polytopic inclusions, a delay-free closed-loop augmented system is established for the IMT powertrain system under discrete-time framework. The proposed controller design problem is then converted to a static output feedback (SOF) controller design problem where the feedback control gains are obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The effectiveness as well as robustness of the proposed controller is demonstrated by comparing its performance against that of a conventional PI controller.

                  Alternative powertrains are considered as a promising option to significantly reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars. One major prerequisite is their successful market introduction. In this paper, we present a system dynamics model that allows for the evaluation of strategies for the market introduction of alternative powertrain technologies in long-range passenger cars (⩾400km) under competition. The model considers two competing manufacturers, one first-mover and one follower, each introducing plug-in hybrids and fuel cell electric vehicles according to exogenously defined strategies, which comprise timing, pricing, and technology parameters. The manufacturers can learn from each other due to technology spillover, leading to cost reductions of the powertrains. We use an exemplary dataset for the German car market to study the manufacturers’ influence on the market success of alternative powertrains as well as the underlying mechanisms. The results indicate that in general more competition leads to higher market shares of alternatively powered vehicles and thus allows for a higher reduction of emissions. However, this might cause decreasing profits for both manufacturers, especially if the follower pursues an aggressive pricing strategy when entering the market to gain market shares from its competitor. Also, technology spillover has a positive effect on the market penetration. This particularly holds true for a low level of technology experience where high cost reductions can be achieved and for fuel cell electric vehicles where the costs of the powertrain are much higher compared to plug-in hybrids.

                  Fuel economy of hybrid vehicles is affected by their powertrain configurations, powertrain parameters, and energy management strategies. It is most beneficial to optimizing all the three factors simultaneously. However, when the design search space is large, an exhaustive, optimal control strategy, such as dynamic programming (DP), is too computationally expensive. Hence, a faster optimization method with higher computational efficiency and acceptable accuracy is required. Based on the DP approach, an approximate optimization method, called rapid dynamic programming (Rapid-DP), is developed and discussed in this paper. This method effectively reduces the decision-making time (the time can be reduced by a factor of 700, compared to the DP approach) for optimal control. The optimization processes and results are described and then compared with the original DP and PEARS + methods under two different driving cycles: FTP72 and HWFET. In conjunction with particle swarm optimization (PSO), the rapid-DP is leveraged, for the first time, to optimize key powertrain parameters for power split hybrid electric vehicles. Based on two power-split hybrids: Toyota Prius and Prius++, the joint optimization approach is exploited to examine vehicular fuel savings attributed to synergistic parameters optimization and operating-mode increase. The multi-mode configuration with optimal component parameters is demonstrated to be most fuel-efficient, with 6.56% and 3.15% fuel reductions under FTP72 and HWFET cycles, respectively, with respect to the original Prius 2010.

                  A simulation software for the assessment of performance, costs and environmental impact of conventional and advanced configuration aircraft has been developed and validated. The software is named PLA.N.E.S. (PLAtform for New Environment-friendly Solutions), and includes a sizing routine and a mission simulator. The simulation is performed with the so-called backward paradigm, i.e. the flight conditions along the mission (altitude and speed versus time) are assumed to be known. Accordingly, the instantaneous power request of the aircraft to meet that flight mission and the corresponding instantaneous fuel consumption are calculated. In the case of advanced powertrains, it is also possible to choose different energy management strategies for the optimal control of the energy flows among engine, secondary equipment and storage systems during the mission. The components currently modeled in PLA.N.E.S. include energy converters (piston and Wankel engines, turboprop, fuel cell, etc.), energy storage systems (batteries, super-capacitors), auxiliaries and secondary power systems. The tool is designed to be integrated with a multi-objective optimization environment. In the present investigation PLA.N.E.S. has been applied to a Medium Altitude Medium Endurance (MAME) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) as a case study to compare an experimentally validated Wankel-based powertrain with a proposed turbocharged diesel piston-prop system.

                  In order to make sure that the heavy duty tracked vehicle can work in various conditions, especially severe cold weather, preheating system of powertrain should be adopted, and a novel preheating system is presented for the tracked hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) in which heat is generated by the low-speed drive motor. The new preheating system can meet the need of cold start without adding any additional device. The characteristic of heat generation by motor is tested when the rotor of motor is rotated in very low speed. The heat loss from power cabin to external environment has been simulated, and the relevant test has been done to verify the simulation results. Combining the characteristic of heat generation and heat loss situation about preheating system, the heat transfer model of preheating system was implemented by MATLAB. The total energy required for preheating in different ambient temperature was calculated by this model. The results showed that: the minimum heating power was 70 kW and energy required was about 180 MJ when the HEV worked in −46 °C. If lithium ferrous phosphate (LFP) battery was used in power system, the minimum battery capacity is about 290 A h.

Improving non-powertrain components reduced vehicle road load and allowed total motive capacity to decrease by 17%, energy use by 11%, manufacturing cost premiums by 13% and CO2 emissions abatement costs by 15%. All vehicles with advanced internal combustion engines, most hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains reduced net CO2 emissions and had lower lifetime operating costs than the respective segment reference vehicle. Most powertrains using fuel cells and all electric vehicles had positive CO2 emissions abatement costs. However, only vehicles using advanced internal combustion engines and parallel hybrid vehicles may be attractive to consumers by the fuel savings offsetting increases in vehicle cost within two years. This work demonstrates that fuel savings are possible relative to today’s fleet, but indicates that the most cost-effective way of reducing fuel consumption and CO2 emissions is by advanced combustion technologies and hybridisation with a parallel topology.

                  Developing successful fuel cell hybrid vehicles (FCHVs), to be destined to the widest deployment within the entire transport sector, is nowadays considered as a highly strategic target to fully meet well known environmental and regulatory constraints at international level. This happens thanks to the intrinsic overall superior features of fuel cell propulsion when compared to both electric and hybrid vehicles, such as high fuel-economy, reduced tank-to-wheel environmental impact and good ranges. Successful achievement of the above-introduced challenging goal motivates the research activity presented and discussed in this paper, namely the development of an advanced mathematical tool featuring co-optimization capabilities. The reason for such a requirement lies in the well-known strong interactions and mutual influence between selected design criteria and adopted control strategies. Therefore, a comprehensive model of a generic FCHV architecture and a specification independent control strategy, thus adaptable to different fuel cell system and battery sizes, were preliminary developed. Then, they were integrated and embedded within a modular constrained optimization algorithm, which was conceived in such a way as to simultaneously find the optimal FCHV powertrain design, as well as real-time applicable control strategies. Suitable design and energy management criteria were investigated on a selected driving cycle, in such a way to explore several powertrain configurations (i.e. more hybrid, as well as more plugin and range-extender like FCHV). This allowed verifying the suitability of the proposed procedure to yield solutions ensuring low hydrogen consumption (i.e. fuel economy as high as 135 km/kg) and full alignment with targeted energy management policies. Discussion of results, together with the physical meaning of main design and control variables provided as outcomes, underline the effectiveness of the proposed tool in providing a solid support in the preliminary design of cost-effective fuel cell powertrains destined to a variety of applications and driving habits.

                  This research proposes a reinforcement learning-based algorithm and a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm for energy management of a series hybrid electric tracked vehicle. Firstly, the powertrain model of the series hybrid electric tracked vehicle (SHETV) is constructed, then the corresponding energy management formulation is established. Subsequently, a new variant of reinforcement learning (RL) method Dyna, namely Dyna-H, is developed by combining the heuristic planning step with the Dyna agent and is applied to energy management control for SHETV. Its rapidity and optimality are validated by comparing with DP and conventional Dyna method. Facing the problem of the “curse of dimensionality” in the reinforcement learning method, a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm deep Q-learning (DQL) is designed for energy management control, which uses a new optimization method (AMSGrad) to update the weights of the neural network. Then the proposed deep reinforcement learning control system is trained and verified by the realistic driving condition with high-precision, and is compared with the benchmark method DP and the traditional DQL method. Results show that the proposed deep reinforcement learning method realizes faster training speed and lower fuel consumption than traditional DQL policy does, and its fuel economy quite approximates to global optimum. Furthermore, the adaptability of the proposed method is confirmed in another driving schedule.

                  The transportation sector is a major contributor to both air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Hybrid electric vehicles can reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by optimizing the energy management of the powertrain. The purpose of this study is to examine the trade-off between regulated pollutant emissions and hybrid powertrain efficiency. The thermal dynamics of the three-way catalyst are taken into account in order to optimize the light-off. Experimental campaigns are conducted on a spark-ignition engine to introduce simplified models for emissions, exhaust gas temperature, catalyst heat transfers and efficiency. These models are used to determine the optimal distribution of a power request between the thermal engine and the electric motor with three-dimensional dynamic programming and a weighted objective function. A pollution-centered scenario is compared with a consumption-centered scenario for various driving cycles. The optimal torque distribution for the emissions-centered scenario on the world harmonized light-duty vehicles test cycle shows an 8–33% decrease in pollutant emissions while the consumption remains stable (0.1% increase). The consistency of the results is analyzed with respect to the discretization parameters, driving cycle, electric motor and battery sizing, as well as emission and catalyst models. The control strategies are promising but will have to be adapted to online engine control where the driving cycle and the catalyst efficiency are uncertain.

                  Efficiently solving the off-line control problem represents a crucial step to predict the fuel economy capability of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Optimal HEV control approaches implemented in literature usually prove to be either computationally inefficient or sub-optimal. Moreover, they often neglect drivability and comfort associated to the generated control actions over time. This paper therefore aims at introducing a rapid near-optimal approach to solve the off-line control problem for parallel and series-parallel HEV powertrains while accounting for drivability criteria such as the frequency of gear shifts and the number of activations of the thermal engine. The performance of the introduced slope-weighted energy-based rapid control analysis (SERCA) algorithm is compared with the global optimal benchmark provided by dynamic programming (DP) for both the parallel and the series-parallel HEV layouts over different driving missions. Results demonstrate how the SERCA algorithm can produce comparable control results with respect to DP by limiting the increase in the estimated fuel consumption within 2.2%. The corresponding computational time can be simultaneously reduced by around 99.5% while ensuring a limited number of gear shifts and engine activations over time. Engineers could therefore potentially implement the proposed SERCA algorithm in design and calibration procedures of parallel and series-parallel HEVs to accelerate the overall vehicle development process.

                  Energy flow analysis is an effective tool for refined development of vehicle to improve its energy efficiency. To reveal the energy-saving principles of hybrid vehicle, a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) which is in charge sustenance phase and a conventional vehicle with the same internal combustion engine (ICE) are selected to conduct energy flow test under New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) of cold start and warm start. Various energy distributions are quantified, the differences are compared, and the influencing factors are analyzed. Research results show that the conventional vehicle with turbocharged engine overcharges in non-supercharging conditions, and this phenomenon could be alleviated in hybrid vehicle. Tested PHEV could reduce the working range of engine to a certain extent through the electrification of powertrain, but the tank-to-wheel efficiency increases little. This indicates that the design purpose of powertrain topology is to ensure that the benefits of improved engine thermal efficiency outweigh the losses caused by longer energy transmission paths. Brake energy regeneration could reduce the demand for effective engine output, which contributes the most to energy saving, so the braking energy should be recovered as much as possible on the premise of safety and driving comfort. The proportion of exhaust gas enthalpy-increase for the tested PHEV is relatively high, and the use of exhaust waste heat recovery technology can further improve its energy efficiency. Compared with tested conventional vehicle, the energy-saving contribution rates of tested PHEV under NEDC are 5% for idling condition, 20% for braking condition, and −5% for driving condition, respectively. These provide guidance for further tapping the potential of hybrid vehicles.

The strategies are implemented using the SAE J1939-standard for engine control and evaluated compared to both the optimal solution and the solution when the engine is restricted to follow its stationary optimal line. It is shown that with the control parameters tuned for a specific criteria both engine control strategies in the SAE J1939-standard, speed control and load control, can achieve almost optimal results, where engine load controlled shows a better trade-off between fuel economy and duration. The controllers are then extended and it is shown that it is possible to control the powertrain in a close to optimal way using the SAE J1939-standard, both with the engine speed and load controlled. However the mode where the engine is load controlled is seen to be more robust.

                  To realize a fast and smooth operating mode transition process from electric driving mode to engine-on driving mode, this paper presents a novel robust hierarchical mode transition control method for a plug-in hybrid electric bus (PHEB) with pre-transmission parallel hybrid powertrain. Firstly, the mode transition process is divided into five stages to clearly describe the powertrain dynamics. Based on the dynamics models of powertrain and clutch actuating mechanism, a hierarchical control structure including two robust H
                     ∞ controllers in both upper layer and lower layer is proposed. In upper layer, the demand clutch torque can be calculated by a robust H
                     ∞controller considering the clutch engaging time and the vehicle jerk. While in lower layer a robust tracking controller with L
                     2-gain is designed to perform the accurate position tracking control, especially when the parameters uncertainties and external disturbance occur in the clutch actuating mechanism. Simulation and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test are carried out in a traditional driving condition of PHEB. Results show that the proposed hierarchical control approach can obtain the good control performance: mode transition time is greatly reduced with the acceptable jerk. Meanwhile, the designed control system shows the obvious robustness with the uncertain parameters and disturbance. Therefore, the proposed approach may offer a theoretical reference for the actual vehicle controller.

                  In the last years, the research effort of the automotive industry has been mainly focused on the reduction of CO2 and pollutants emissions. In this scenario, concepts such as the engines downsizing, stop/start systems as well as more costly full hybrid solutions and, more recently, Waste Heat Recovery technologies have been proposed. These latter include Thermo-Electric Generator (TEG), Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) and Electric Turbo-Compound (ETC) that have been practically implemented on few heavy-duty applications but have not been proved yet as effective and affordable solutions for passenger cars.
                  The paper deals with the analysis of opportunities and challenges of the ETC for a compact car, powered by a turbocharged SI engine. The ETC consists of a motor-generator unit (MGU) integrated into the turbo shaft that can operate either as generator or motor. In the paper the benefits achievable by the electric turbo-compound have been investigated by simulation analyses carried out by a dynamic engine-vehicle model, validated against steady-state and transient experimental data. The in-cylinder processes and friction losses of the engine are modelled by a black-box parametric approach while grey-box dynamic models are applied for intake/exhaust manifolds and turbocharger to simulate more realistically the effect of ETC on engine performance and fuel economy along vehicle transients.
                  The simulations have been carried out considering standard driving cycles (i.e. NEDC, WLTC) and several ETC management strategies. The results evidence that significant improvement of fuel economy and CO2 reduction can be achieved by suitable management of ETC operation, depending on engine speed and load and auxiliaries demand.

                  The complexity of automobile powertrains continues to rise, leading to increased development time and effort. Synchronous testing with spatially distributed test benches allows improvements by front-loading of the validation phase. Nevertheless, virtualization of the mechanical interaction of shaft connections is required. A virtual shaft algorithm (VSA) is investigated for synchronized motion control in separate test benches. The behavior of a rigid mechanical shaft is analyzed and modeled. The mechanical shaft is substituted by two electrical motors and a superimposed VSA controller. This virtual shaft is established between two test benches for a combustion engine and a mechanical transmission. Control algorithms for synchronized motion control, known from web machines and force feedback, are analyzed. A controller layout with separate torque and speed controllers is implemented and analyzed through transfer function mathematics. The controllers are parametrized analytically for different gears. The effect of communication delay on the VSA is analyzed by simulation. The open clutch situation is handled by deactivation of the torque feedback. Validation on real test benches shows small deviations for torque and speed. Further work will focus on the necessity of system knowledge for controller layout and on the transient behavior during shifting.

                  Stringent regulations on exhaust emission and fuel economy for vehicles have become major issues in the automotive industry. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are one of the crucial alternative plans over current conventional vehicles, but they have drawbacks, such as the increase of engine-out total hydrocarbon (THC) emission and the deterioration of combustion stability with frequent engine stopping and restarting. This study is an experimental investigation to obtain a better understanding of THC emission characteristics during engine restart and deceleration driving on a HEV powertrain of a parallel motor/generator type. Using a fast response flame ionization detector (FFID) and a specified tool for cycle by cycle and cylinder to cylinder investigation, the combustion stability and engine control characteristics were analyzed during the transient state of the HEV powertrain. The experimental conditions cover variations of the high voltage battery state of charge (SoC), spark ignition timing and injected fuel mass. As an experimental result, the effect of the spark timing control was slight, but the reasonable injection duration for stable combustion was more than 7ms at the first cycle shortly after engine start-up, although the injection rate was 2.7–3ms in the idle state. The reason for the greater volume of fuel being injected was that the fuel deposited in the cylinder and intake port was reduced due to discharge and vaporization during the deceleration step before the idle stop. A basic control algorithm for combustion stability under engine restart conditions was built by considering the experimental results.

                  This paper proposes a bi-level eco-driving control strategy for connected and automated hybrid electric vehicles (CAHEVs) under mixed driving scenarios. First, the hybrid electric vehicle powertrain is modelled, and the communications via Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) are introduced as the main data sources for the decision-making of the control system. Next, the problem is divided into three objectives, namely, (1) safe driving, (2) energy management, and (3) exhaust emission reduction. Based on the real-time road information, the driving scenario classifier (DSC) works towards determining the corresponding vehicle mode on which the cost function can be adjusted accordingly. The simulation is carried out in a realistic urban traffic simulation environment in SUMO. The results show that with the proposed model predictive control (MPC)-based strategy applied, safe driving in a trip involving a mixture of driving scenarios can be guaranteed throughout the entire driving. In addition, in comparison to the rule-based benchmark strategy, the proposed strategy can reduce the fuel consumption by 34.10% with battery kept in a healthy state of charge range, and the exhaust emissions (HC, CO, and NOx) are reduced by 25.36%, 72.30%, and 30.39%, respectively, which demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MPC-based strategy for CAHEVs.

This paper presents the first study in literature that investigates the potential of fuel savings of an extended range hybrid electric vehicle using a thermoelectric generator system as energy converter substitute to the conventional internal combustion engine. An exergo-technological explicit analysis is conducted to identify the different thermodynamic configurations. An extended range vehicle model is considered and the different configurations are integrated as auxiliary power unit. Fuel consumption simulations are performed on the worldwide-harmonized light vehicles test cycle. Results are compared to the reference internal combustion engine operating as auxiliary power unit.

This innovative thermodynamic configuration identified through the methodology proposed in this paper has been patented. Also, this study highlights the importance of increasing the thermoelectric generator’s module merit factor in order to achieve system efficiency comparable to the internal combustion engine, which makes this energy converter a potential for the implementation in future powertrains with zero carbon alternative fuels.

Expressions for conduction and switching losses in the electronic devices acting as the converter switches, and copper and core losses in the isolation transformer, are derived and accounted for in the DC-DC converter model. DPS control involves many more converter operating conditions, in comparison to the more common single-phase-shift (SPS) control, which makes the analytic power loss characterization of a DPS-controlled converter an arduous task. Subsequently and by employing the derived analytic converter power loss model with exemplary parameter values, the paper analyzes the efficiency of a high-fidelity full hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) model that includes a DAB DC-DC converter, under a wide range of realistic driving conditions and converter operation, including low- to high-speed driving, and converter DPS operation. Two popular hybrid powertrain energy management schemes, the Thermostat and Power Follower control strategies, are used to simulate the vehicle model to reinforce the range of realistic vehicle operating conditions. The results show that in series HEV applications more accurate modeling of DC-DC converter models than conventional constant efficiency models is required to predict converter losses, and also the fidelity in the characterization of converter losses can have a significant impact on the vehicle fuel consumption prediction.

To systematically explore all the possible designs of multi-mode hybrid designs with planetary gears, a topology-control-size-integrated optimization approach is presented. A novel near-optimal energy management strategy, Efficiency Evaluation Real-time Control Strategy (EERCS), is proposed to rapidly calculate near-optimal control rules for design candidates. The EERCS is confirmed to achieve results similar to those of Dynamic Programming (DP), yet the computation time is over 50 times less. With the help of EERCS, the optimal design together with its parameters is computed using multi-objective optimization based on a meta-heuristic algorithm.

In this study, the effects of different EV powertrain topologies on the energy efficiency, vehicle ownership cost and lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of EVs are investigated. Energy-based vehicle simulation model including the regenerative braking function and battery degradation prediction method is established firstly. An optimization scheme combining the energy-based vehicle simulation model is conducted to minimize the electric energy consumption under various scenarios and driving conditions. Then the vehicle ownership cost and lifecycle GHG emissions of EVs are evaluated based on Chinese EV market and electricity grid. The sensitivity analyses of EV powertrain topology are implemented based on the different vehicle weights, CO2 intensities of electricity and all-electric ranges. Results show that EVs using the powertrain of wheel-hub drive with the gear reducer have lower energy consumption. Furthermore, the driving cycles with more aggressive acceleration/deceleration and frequently stop-and-go conditions can increase both the vehicle ownership cost and lifecycle GHG emissions simultaneously. Chinese city traffic conditions will help EVs to obtain more benefits in respect of the economy and environment.

Furthermore, the driving cycles with more aggressive acceleration/deceleration and frequently stop-and-go conditions can increase both the vehicle ownership cost and lifecycle GHG emissions simultaneously. Chinese city traffic conditions will help EVs to obtain more benefits in respect of the economy and environment.

                  Instead of using conventional starter, engine can be started through slipping of the disconnect clutch in P2 hybrid automatic transmission. However, both riding comfort and engine-start time are challenges for control of the starting process. In order to achieve smooth and quick engine start, this paper proposed an optimized control strategy with respect to different engine-start situations. Firstly, a model of P2 hybrid powertrain is developed to characterize the transient behavior during engine start and provide support for developing control strategies. A multiphase control strategy is then proposed to cope with the control objective of either good riding comfort or short starting time depending on different driving situations. A nonlinear feedforward-feedback controller based on differential flatness and proportional-integral-derivative (PID) algorithm is developed to regulate the current of direct operating solenoid valve. Thus the pressure of the disconnect clutch can be fine-tuned and good tracking capability for the reference trajectory of engine speed can be realized. Finally, simulation and test results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy and controller can satisfy different requirements for engine start. Both riding comfort and engine-start time of a P2 hybrid vehicle can be effectively improved in the engine starting process.

                  Wheel loaders often have a highly repetitive pattern of operation, which can be used for creating a rough prediction of future operation. As the present torque converter based transmission is replaced with an infinitely variable device, such as an electric or hydraulic transmission, a freedom in the choice of engine speed is introduced. This choice is far from trivial in the extremely transient operation of these machines, but the availability of a load prediction should be utilized.
                  In this paper, a predictive engine and generator controller, based on stochastic dynamic programming, is described, implemented and evaluated. The evaluation is performed against non-predictive controllers in the same system, to lift out any possible benefits of utilizing the repetition based prediction. Simulations and field tests show that the controllers are able to handle disturbances introduced from model errors, the machine environment and the human operator, and that the predictive controller gives around 5% lower fuel consumption than the non-predictive reference controllers.

The goal of this study is to perform a detailed life cycle analysis, including manufacturing, use and disposal, of key components of EV powertrains, identifying materials and processes responsible for abiotic depletion impact. This study also investigates the sensitivity of the results to the choice of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) impact methods. For this, a LCA is performed on an integrated electric drive, by considering seven impact methods.

However, these two aspects are usually coupled such that it is not reasonable to discuss them separately from a system-level design perspective. Therefore, this review briefly discusses the popular PMS, followed by a detailed CS review in different aspects, including the classic and optimization-based with their own subtypes. In addition, several case studies belonging to different optimization structures are also reviewed in detail to demonstrate the features and the main conclusions of each method. As the comparison results show that with the proper CS methods, the hybrid powertrain witness a large fuel saving compared to their conventional counterparts. Furthermore, factors or issues that affect the performance of the PMS and CS methods are discussed. Meanwhile, the future research trends in PMS and CS are elaborated. This study intends to help researchers to have an overview of the state-of-the-art in PMS and CS methods and more importantly, to provide directions for optimal powertrain and power management controller designs for cost-effective and environmental-friendly vehicles.

                  This paper reports a methodology to design a high efficiency fuel cell powertrain. The powertrain equips a prototype car that runs energy-efficient races where the objectives are to go the furthest with the lowest quantity of fuel (Shell Eco Marathon). In the design process, the starting point was the evaluation of the car's energy demand to run on a specified race track by developing a dynamic mechanical model of the car. A dedicated inertial test bench was constructed to reproduce the car's behavior in the laboratory. This was used to determine under which operating conditions an electric motor has to be powered to reach the highest efficiency. The introduction of ultracapacitors was envisaged and, based on efficiency arguments, a drive train arrangement was chosen composed solely of a 500 W PEFC stack, a DC/DC converter operated in a current regulation mode and an electric motor. Final tests of the powertrain revealed the most efficient operating conditions.

The powertrain equips a prototype car that runs energy-efficient races where the objectives are to go the furthest with the lowest quantity of fuel (Shell Eco Marathon). In the design process, the starting point was the evaluation of the car's energy demand to run on a specified race track by developing a dynamic mechanical model of the car. A dedicated inertial test bench was constructed to reproduce the car's behavior in the laboratory. This was used to determine under which operating conditions an electric motor has to be powered to reach the highest efficiency. The introduction of ultracapacitors was envisaged and, based on efficiency arguments, a drive train arrangement was chosen composed solely of a 500 W PEFC stack, a DC/DC converter operated in a current regulation mode and an electric motor. Final tests of the powertrain revealed the most efficient operating conditions. The present work is the necessary first stage for both the design of the complete powertrain and its detailed energy analysis. It forms the basis for future improvements.

                  The transition to low-carbon mobility could lead to drastic increases in critical mineral requirements risking adverse ecological and societal impacts. Assessments of climate change mitigation potential of new technologies often pay less attention to the criticality of the enabling minerals. We assessed the effects of adopting 4 hybrid architectures on the life-cycle GHG emissions of an emerging fuel and powertrain solution: the use of a novel high-reactivity fuel in an advanced compression-ignition engine (GCI). The 4 hybrids were contrasted against conventional fuels/engines, and a comparable battery electric vehicle using regionally-explicit power mixes in the 3 biggest automotive markets worldwide (China, USA and Europe). The use of larger batteries enabled higher degrees of electrification and it could lead to lower overall emissions. However, there is diminishing returns for every kWh of increasing battery size: a mild hybrid resulted in more than 50% GHG reduction per kWh of battery, whereas an electric vehicle only reduced emission by 4% per kWh given its much larger battery requirement. Given the sustainability constraints of critical raw minerals supply, and the heterogeneity of regional power grids, advanced GCI hybrid architectures, with varying degrees of electrification, can bridge the gap in the interim.

                  Hybridization of automotive powertrains by using more than one type of energy converter is considered as an important step towards reducing fuel consumption and air pollutants. Specifically, the development of energy efficient, highly complex, alternative drive-train systems, in which the interactions of different energy converters play an important role, requires new design methods and processes. This paper discusses the inclusion of an alternative hybrid power train into an existing vehicle platform for maximum energy efficiency. The new proposed integrated Vehicle Hardware In-the-loop (VHiL) and Model Based Design (MBD) approach is utilized to evaluate the energy efficiency of electrified powertrain. In VHiL, a complete chassis system becomes an integrated part of the vehicle test bed. A complete conventional Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) powered vehicle is tested in roller bench test for the integration of energy efficient hybrid electric power train modules in closed-loop, real-time, feedback configuration. A model that is a replica of the test vehicle is executed – in real-time- where all hybrid power train modules are included. While the VHiL platform is controlling the signal exchange between the test bed automation software and the vehicle on-board controller, the road load exerted on the driving wheels is manipulated in closed –loop real-time manner in order to reflect all hybrid driving modes including: All Electric Range (AER), Electric Power Assist (EPA) and blended Modes (BM). Upon successful implementation of VHiL, a comparative study between Rule Based (RB) energy management strategy (EMS) and Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) to Control Parallel Through-The-Road Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PTTR-HEV) is performed. The study shows that the actual fuel efficiency of the tested vehicle under both control strategies can be used in order to evaluate the effectiveness of energy conversion efficiency of the powertrain system. The fuel consumption of hybridized powertrain is compared with the conventional powertrain equipped in an actual vehicle to help comprehend the degree of efficiency attained by the hybridization. This process is developed in order to enable effective tuning/validation of advanced energy management strategies utilized in hybrid electric powertrain through an evaluation of a complete real chassis system subject to electric hybridization. The VHiL is considered as new evolution for the utilization of vehicle test bed as a predictive mechatronic platform for the development of energy efficient electrified propulsion systems and thus reduce cost and time.

                  Significant research efforts are considered in the automotive industry on the use of low carbon alternative fuels in order to reduce carbon emissions of future vehicles, some of which are only compatible with external combustion machines. These machines are only suitable for electrified powertrains relying on electric propulsion, particularly in range extenders, where the energy converter operates steadily at a constant power at its optimal efficiency. The fuel consumption of these powertrains strongly relies on the performance of the energy converter in terms of efficiency, as well as on the deployed energy management strategy. This paper investigates the potential of fuel savings of a Extended Range hybrid Electric Vehicle (EREV) using a Thermoacoustic Engine (TAE) system as energy converter substitute to the conventional Internal Combustion Engine (ICE). An exergo-technological explicit analysis is conducted to identify the different TAE-system thermodynamic configurations. The Regenerative Reheat two-stage thermoacoustic engine is selected among numerous identified thermodynamic configurations, offering high efficiency and net specific work compared to other configurations.

Fuel consumption simulations are performed on the Worldwide-harmonized Light Vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC). Results are compared to the reference ICE-APU. Results show more than 20% of fuel savings with the RRe-n2-TAE as Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) compared to the basic TAE configuration and comparable fuel consumption with the ICE. Consequently, the studied RRe-n2-TEG-APU presents a potential for the implementation in EREVs with zero carbon alternative fuels.

                  With the addition of an energy storage system (ESS) and advanced controls, a hybrid electric propulsion system can considerably improve the fuel economy over a pure mechanical powertrain. However, the high cost and relatively short operating life of the battery ESS constitute a significant portion of the total operation cost (TOC) of an electrified vehicle, particularly for heavy-duty vehicles with a larger ESS. In this work, a new method for generating the optimal energy management strategy (EMS), considering the TOC of a hybrid electric mining truck (HEMT), is introduced. The cost associated with battery performance degradation and operation life-shortening under different battery use patterns is added to form the globally optimal, TOC-based EMS. The optimal EMS under different vehicle operation profiles are identified using dynamic programming (DP) to serve as benchmarks. An intelligent optimal ESS energy management method for achieving the minimum TOC during real-time, open-pit HEMT operations is introduced by combining an artificial neural network (ANN) model and a fuzzy-logic controller (FLC). The new, real-time intelligent optimal EMS led to twenty-one percent TOC reduction of the HEMT over the traditional, pure fuel economy-oriented optimal EMS, and formed the foundation of TOC-based, optimal EMS development for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs).

                  This research proposes an optimal controller to improve fuel efficiency for a vehicle equipped with automatic transmission traveling on rolling terrain without the presence of a close preceding vehicle. Vehicle acceleration and transmission gear position are optimized simultaneously to achieve a better fuel efficiency. This research leverages the emerging Connected Vehicle technology and utilizes present and future information—such as real-time dynamic speed limit, vehicle speed, location and road topography—as optimization input. The optimal control is obtained using the Relaxed Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle. The benefit of the proposed optimal controller is significant compared to the regular cruise control and other eco-drive systems. It varies with the hill length, grade, and the number of available gear positions. It ranges from an increased fuel saving of 18–28% for vehicles with four-speed transmission and 25–45% for vehicles with six-speed transmission. The computational time for the optimization is 1.0–2.1s for the four-speed vehicle and 1.8–3.9s for the six-speed vehicle, given a 50s optimization time horizon and 0.1s time step. The proposed controller can potentially be used in real-time.

The primary goal of this paper is to study the performance of partial power-on gear shifts through the implementation of torque hole filling by the electric motor during gear changes. To achieve this goal, mathematical models of both conventional and mild hybrid powertrain are developed and used to compare the system dynamic performance of the two systems. This mathematical modelling is used to run different simulations for gear-shift control algorithm design during system development, allowing us to evaluate the achievable performance and its dependency on system properties. The impact of motor power on the degree of torque hole compensation is also investigated, keeping in mind the practical limits to motor specification. This investigation uses both the output torque, vehicle speed as well as vibration dose value to evaluate the quality of gearshifts at different motor sizes. Results demonstrate that the torque hole may be eliminated using a motor power of 50kW. However, the minimum vibration dose value during gear change is achieved using a peak power of 16–20kW.

                  The light-duty vehicle market has seen some adoption of hybrid electric vehicles that is not reflected in the heavy-duty market. The major challenges associated with the heavy-duty segment are: (i) greater emphasis on economic viability, (ii) reluctance to take on risk associated with new technologies, and (iii) numerous diverse applications that preclude a one-size-fits-all approach to hybrid-electric powertrain design. To overcome these challenges, a model-based framework is required that enables the exploration and optimal design of powertrain architectures for diverse applications while capturing the impact of hybridization on the economics of ownership under different economic scenarios. This paper demonstrates such a framework that incorporates powertrain simulation and battery degradation models to predict fuel consumption, electrical energy consumption, and battery replacements. These results are combined with economic assumptions to enable the exploration of a large design space (which spans powertrain design & control variables, noise variables, and economic scenarios) from a total cost-of-ownership perspective to provide better insights to vehicle integrators, component manufacturers, and buyers of heavy-duty hybrid electric vehicles. The methodology is applied to series plug-in hybrid electric and extended-range electric powertrain architectures for medium duty truck applications. The results show that under the assumptions made, economically favorable solutions for series plug-in hybrid electric medium-duty trucks exist in the 2020 time-frame for the NY Composite Truck drive cycle, while for the HTUF Refuse Truck and HTUF Class 6 P&D Truck drive cycles, feasible solutions are not obtained until 2025 and 2030 time-frames respectively.

                  This paper presents a comparative study of two promising real-time energy management strategies for fuel cell electric vehicle applications: adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (A-ECMS), and stochastic dynamic programming (SDP). An off-line algorithm –classic dynamic programming - provides reference results. On-line and off-line strategies are tested both in simulation and using a dedicated test bench completely consistent with an electric scooter powertrain.
                  The hybrid power source combines a fuel cell, a supercapacitor pack and two related power converters. The system model is carefully calibrated using experimental data. This allows meaningful identification of parameters of the various strategies. The model data is determined using a motorcycle certification driving cycle.
                  The robustness of each strategy is then analyzed using a large number of random driving cycles. Experimental and simulation results show that a specific SDP approach, based on Markov chain modeling, has the best overall performance in real-world driving conditions. It achieves the minimum average hydrogen consumption while respecting the state-sustaining constraint. Conversely, the A-ECMS results lack robustness and show poor performance indexes when facing unknown real world power demand profile. In conclusion, the present results indicate SDP is an interesting approach for future hybrid source energy allocation.

                  In this paper, motor torque control methods are proposed to suppress the vibration of a dual-motor hybrid powertrain during start-stop operation. Firstly, a co-simulation ADAMS and MATLAB/SIMULINK model is built to study the dynamic characteristics of the hybrid vehicle during modes switching process. Secondly, a torque compensation control method of electric motors is established to compensate the vibration energy source. Thirdly, a vibration transfer path control is built to change the dynamic properties during the engine start-stop process. The results show that the proposed methods can reduce the longitudinal acceleration amplitude of the vehicle to less than 0.4 m/s2, which is only about 30% of the uncontrolled system, during the engine start process.

                  This study proposes a modeling method for optimal real-time control of a continuously variable transmission (CVT)-based plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), which is designed to solve a highly coupled nonlinear optimization problem namely the control of the transmission ratio (TR) and the power split ratio (PSR). Power transmission and power consumption models were first established by carefully introducing convex approximations and relaxations of the powertrain components. Then, the minimum equivalent fuel consumption problem was formulated and converted to a standard convex quadratic programming (QP) problem. Based on the QP modeling method, the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) was proposed and verified by hardware-in-the-loop tests, computational efficiency simulations, and performance simulations. The results obtained indicated that the computational efficiency and effectiveness of the QP-based modeling method are high enough to be applied to real-world vehicle controllers, and the fuel economy can be improved significantly as compared to an ECMS without integrated optimization. It was concluded that the QP-based modeling method has high practical value and broad prospects for application to real-time optimal control.

                  The calibration of fuel-efficient energy management strategies (EMSs) for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) requires an in-depth understanding of the powertrain component’s operation mode and, in particular, its optimal interaction. The derivation of optimal EMSs under stationary operating conditions and its application to the design process of rule-based operating strategies has thoroughly been researched in the past. However, when considering the warm-up period at cold ambient temperatures, the interaction becomes more complex and strongly influenced by transient component characteristics. The efficiency of pure electric driving (ED) and engine load point shifting (LPS) changes within the warm-up period and is even more affected by the respective driving route. Looking at the cabin heating demand suggests the possibility of an EMS being predictive and completely divergent at a first glance in order to provide a sufficient amount of waste heat for cabin heating purposes. This paper applies a forward dynamic programming (FDP) approach in order to focus on the impact of the transient internal combustion engine (ICE) temperature on an optimal operating strategy for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Thresholds of efficient electric driving and engine characteristics with respect to optimal load point shifting are analyzed. Additionally, a set of representative driving routes is studied in order to gain further insights into the fuel saving potentials of predictive energy and thermal management strategies.

With the increasing of the requirements of the customer’s satisfaction nowadays, vibration control is getting progressively more attention. Since the transmission system components are elastic to some extent, meantime the torque of the motor responds quickly for a sudden acceleration, hence torsional vibration takes place, henceforth the passengers will suffer inconvenience attributable to this vibration.

Primarily, a dynamic modeling of the power-split hybrid vehicle is built, in addition the uncertainty caused by the variable transmission ratio is analyzed. Moreover, this paper proposes a method combining the model reference adaptive control and the pole configuration method to solve the torsional vibration active control problem with uncertainties.

Furthermore, this paper designs a dynamic coordinated control algorithm combined with active vibration control strategy, which ensures the dynamic performance and comfort performance of the vehicle.

                  This paper presents a novel full hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) with power split electronic-continuously variable transmission (e-CVT) capable of providing dual-motor drive at purely electric drive and operating under either the input-split or output-split mode at hybrid drive. This powertrain consists of one engine, one motor, and one generator with a specific mechanical link among two planetary gearsets, one controllable clutch, and two one-way clutches. The corresponding kinematic architecture and operating modes are described, and analyzed in view of the characteristics of electric circulation. Then, the driving performance is simulated and compared with that of the baseline system with the original specifications of Toyota Prius. The results show that, with the significant 18% reduction of total power capacity of the motor and generator, the dual-motor electric drive can still satisfy the requirement of driving performance at low speed. The maximum percentage of improvement of driving performance for electric drive, circulation, and boost modes compared with those of the baseline system are 24%, 80%, and 48% respectively. Furthermore, the simulation on driving performance as well as energy efficiency shows that the input-split and output-split modes are preferably operated at low and high end of vehicle speed respectively. Therefore, the integrated input- and output-split e-CVT operation can provide superior performance covering the entire range of driving speed. As a result, the outstanding feature of the proposed system offers promising potential of further development especially for plug-in and sport hybrid application.

                  The paper introduces an advanced DC-link variable voltage control methodology that improves significantly the fuel economy of series Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs). The DC-link connects a rectifier, a Dual Active Bridge (DAB) DC-DC converter and an inverter, interfacing respectively the two sources and the load in a series HEV powertrain. The introduced Dual Phase Shift (DPS) proportional voltage conversion ratio control scheme is realized by manipulating the phase shifts of the gating signals in the DAB converter, to regulate the amount of DAB converter power flow in and out of the DC-link. Dynamic converter efficiency models are utilized to account for switching, conduction, copper and core losses. The control methodology is proposed on the basis of improving the individual efficiency of the DAB converter but with its parameters tuned to minimize the powertrain fuel consumption. Since DPS control has one additional degree of freedom as compared to Single Phase Shift (SPS) voltage control schemes, a Lagrange Multiplier optimization method is applied to minimize the leakage inductance peak current, the main cause for switching and conduction losses. The DPS control scheme is tested in simulations with a full HEV model and two associated conventional supervisory control algorithms, together with a tuned SPS proportional voltage conversion ratio control scheme, against a conventional PI control in which the DC-link voltage follows a constant reference. Nonlinear coupling difficulties associated with the integration of varying DC-link voltage in the powertrain are also exposed and addressed.

                  The pre-determined city bus routes and the availability of partial-trip information obtained through vehicular connectivity provides new opportunities for plug-in vehicles to plan electric energy reasonably. This paper presents a data-driven hierarchical control method for online energy management of plug-in hybrid electric city buses, which can learn from globally optimal solutions based on historical accumulated cycles while taking advantage of connectivity-enabled partial-trip information. The devised scheme comprises two levels of control modules. The upper battery state-of-charge planner trained using historical optimal data is employed for deriving a reference state-of-charge based on the current battery state, remaining trip length, and low/high speed ratios. The lower powertrain controller is then applied to regulate the engine operation according to the reference state-of-charge and powertrain states. This article presents two contributions: (1) both accumulated historical optimal data and partial-trip information are assimilated to augment the applicability of the control hierarchy, thus achieving better resilience to “unseen” driving patterns; (2) given limited resources of micro-controllers, the control strategy is proven to be a real-time implementable, close-to-optimal solution. A variety of results show that the proposed approach can achieve significant fuel savings (4.99%–14.80%) as compared to the charge depleting and charge sustaining strategy.

                  Transportation sector is one of the major sources of pollutants as it contributes more than 80% of CO, while almost all HC and 90% of NOx and PM. Although battery electric vehicles are well-known for reducing environmental pollution, the driving range and battery lifespan put a significant barrier to its large-scale commercialization. In this study, an integrated system, which includes an uninterrupted dual input transmission and hybrid energy storage system, is proposed to improve energy efficiency and extend battery lifespan. Given the limitations of dynamic programming in practice, a real-time optimal control strategy is designed to evaluate the power loss and battery capacity degradation of the proposed integrated system based on detailed mathematical models of individual powertrain components. To achieve a desirable trade-off between battery degradation, energy consumption, and acquisition cost, a mixed-integer multi-objective genetic algorithm is implemented to optimize the parameters of the hybrid energy storage system, while Pareto principal is adopted to find the proper solution according to different purposes. The simulation results reveal that the proposed integrated system shows the potential of saving 15.85%–20.82% of the energy consumption in typical driving cycles and more than 22.61%–31.11% Life-cycle cost compared with the single-ratio transmission-based battery electric vehicles. The selected Pareto front can further enhance Life-cycle cost from 26.53% to 28.13% in the HWFET cycle. It can be concluded that the integrated uninterrupted dual input transmission and hybrid energy storage system not only can improve motor efficiency and reduce energy consumption, it also can extend the battery lifespan to decrease Life-cycle cost compared to conventional single-ratio battery-only EV.

Particular emphasis is put on the operation phase (Tank-to-Wheel, TTW) of the city buses using the Advanced Vehicle Simulator (ADVISOR). The simulations are based on real-world driving patterns collected from Curitiba, comprising 42 driving cycles that represent city bus operation on seven BRT routes with six operation times for each.
                  Hybrid-electric and plug-in hybrid-electric two-axle city buses use 30% and 75% less WTW fossil energy per distance compared to a conventional two-axle city bus (19.46MJfossil,WTW/km). This gives an absolute reduction of 1115gCO2e,WTW/km in WTW GHG emissions when operating a plug-in hybrid-electric city bus instead of a conventional two-axle city bus (1539gCO2e,WTW/km). However, a conventional bi-articulated city bus can be environment-friendlier than hybrid-electric city buses in terms of WTW fossil energy use and WTW GHG emissions per passenger-distance, if its passenger capacity is sufficiently utilised. Nonetheless, the plug-in hybrid-electric city bus remains the most energy-efficient and less polluting option. Hybrid-electric and plug-in hybrid-electric powertrains offer the possibility to achieve much higher levels of decarbonisation in the BRT system in Curitiba than the blending mandate of 7%vol biodiesel into diesel implemented in Brazil in 2016. In addition, the simulations show that TTW energy use can considerably vary by up to 77% between different operation times, BRT routes and types of city buses.

                  This paper deals with hybrid energy storage system (HESS) management strategies, optimized for urban road electric vehicle applications. These new control strategies aim to extend battery pack durability by reducing charging/discharging current peaks by means of supercapacitors. The optimization is carried out with reference to the case study of a HESS composed of a high power unit, i.e. supercapacitor module plus a high energy unit, i.e. a battery pack, based on nickel-chloride ZEBRA (ZEolite Battery Research Africa) technology. On-board integration of the two storage devices is obtained through a DC/DC bidirectional power converter, as this configuration is particularly convenient for many kinds of urban vehicle operations. The novelty of this work consists in an analytical methodology, based on non-linear programming and calculus of variations theory, to evaluate management strategies characterized by high effectiveness in reducing battery current transients. The identification and optimization of these strategies are initially performed on the basis of a vehicle model, built in the Matlab-Simulink simulation environment. To this purpose, the experimental characterization of the supercapacitor module is obtained with reference to three different models, whose selection depends on the required fitting performance and computational effort indexes, as evaluated in the paper. The energy management strategies identified show promising results in the simulation environment, followed by experimental activities carried out by means of a dedicated 1:1 scale laboratory test bench. The various experimental results presented in this manuscript highlight that the identified λ-control strategy presents effectiveness values up to 57%, close to the ideal results obtained in the simulation environment. In fact, the methodology proposed in this paper, validated by laboratory experiments, definitely reduces the negative consequences of power peaks on the HESS, indicating the real possibility of using these results in the design and control of urban road vehicles.

                  This paper proposes a new set of design principles to classify and design rule-based control strategies for the powertrain energy management of series hybrid electric vehicles. The design principles proposed consider the two most established rule-based control strategies for series hybrid electric vehicles, the Thermostat and the Power follower control strategies, and also an optimization-based control strategy, the Equivalent consumption minimization strategy, in terms of the mechanisms they employ to ensure charge sustaining operation and fuel efficient driving. Thus, the work then reflects upon the most effective design principles and derives a novel and superior rule-based control strategy for series hybrid electric vehicles that is claimed to outperform all the existing rule-based schemes in terms of fuel economy: the optimal primary source strategy (OPSS). The OPSS is implemented and then compared on a high fidelity hybrid electric vehicle model to Thermostat, Power follower and Equivalent consumption minimization strategies, as well as to a recently developed rule-based control strategy, the Exclusive operation strategy. As compared to conventional rule-based control strategies, the OPSS is found to deliver significantly improved fuel economy and which is remarkably close to that achieved by the optimization-based Equivalent consumption minimization strategy, while the design of the OPSS is simple and robust as compared to optimization-based strategies. The impressive performance is partly attributed to the recent improvements in engine start stop system technology. It is also shown that the battery is operated in a more steady manner, with a lower depth of discharge, consequently reducing battery degradation.

                  The powertrain system of a typical proton electrolyte membrane hybrid fuel cell vehicle contains a lithium battery package and a fuel cell stack. A multi-objective optimization for this powertrain system of a passenger car, taking account of fuel economy and system durability, is discussed in this paper. Based on an analysis of the optimum results obtained by dynamic programming, a soft-run strategy was proposed for real-time and multi-objective control algorithm design. The soft-run strategy was optimized by taking lithium battery size into consideration, and implemented using two real-time algorithms. When compared with the optimized dynamic programming results, the power demand-based control method proved more suitable for powertrain systems equipped with larger capacity batteries, while the state of charge based control method proved superior in other cases. On this basis, the life cycle cost was optimized by considering both lithium battery size and equivalent hydrogen consumption. The battery capacity selection proved more flexible, when powertrain systems are equipped with larger capacity batteries. Finally, the algorithm has been validated in a fuel cell city bus.

                  In this study, a blended energy management strategy considering influences of driving conditions is proposed to improve the fuel economy of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. To attain it, dynamic programming is firstly applied to solve and quantify influences of different driving conditions and driving distances. Then, the driving condition is identified by the K-means clustering algorithm in real time with the help of Global Positioning System and Geographical Information System. A blended energy management strategy is proposed to achieve the real-time energy allocation of the powertrain with incorporation of the identified driving conditions and the extracted rules, which includes the engine starting scheme, gear shifting schedule and torque distribution strategy. Simulation results reveal that the proposed strategy can effectively adapt to different driving conditions with the dramatic improvement of fuel economy and the decrement of calculation intensity and highlight the feasibility of real-time implementation.

Then, the driving condition is identified by the K-means clustering algorithm in real time with the help of Global Positioning System and Geographical Information System. A blended energy management strategy is proposed to achieve the real-time energy allocation of the powertrain with incorporation of the identified driving conditions and the extracted rules, which includes the engine starting scheme, gear shifting schedule and torque distribution strategy. Simulation results reveal that the proposed strategy can effectively adapt to different driving conditions with the dramatic improvement of fuel economy and the decrement of calculation intensity and highlight the feasibility of real-time implementation.

                  Due to the high mileage and heavy load capabilities of hybrid commercial vehicles, energy management becomes crucial in improving their fuel economy. In this paper, terrain information is systematically integrated into the energy management strategy for a power-split hybrid electric bus based on a deep reinforcement learning approach: the deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. Specially, this energy management method is improved and capable of searching optimal energy management strategies in a discrete-continuous hybrid action space, which, in this work, consists of two continuous actions for the engine and four discrete actions for powertrain mode selections. Additionally, a Critic network with dueling architecture and a pre-training stage ahead of the reinforcement learning process are combined for efficient strategy learning with the adopted algorithm. Assuming the current terrain information was available to the controller, the deep reinforcement learning based energy management strategy is trained and tested on different driving cycles and simulated terrains. Simulation results of the trained strategy show that reasonable energy allocation schemes and mode switching rules are learned simultaneously. Its fuel economy gap with the baseline strategy using dynamic programming is narrowed down to nearly 6.4% while reducing the times of engine starts by around 76%. Further comparisons also indicate approximately 2% promotion in fuel economy is contributed by the incorporation of terrain information in this learning-based energy management. The main contribution of this study is to explore the inclusion of terrain information in a learning-based energy management method that can deal with large hybrid action spaces.

As an important part of the vehicle's powertrain, the E-drive axle was employed to drive the vehicle, capture the breaking energy and match the required speeds of the differential. The configuration and parameters of the powertrain of the hybrid fuel cell/battery bus are given in detail. To extend the life of the fuel cell stacks, the change in the output power of fuel cell stacks is controlled to be gradual via a DC–DC converter depending on the energy management strategy, which was described in this paper. An energy analysis based on a chosen driving cycle has been conducted to study the efficiency of the proposed powertrain, which shows that the hydrogen consumption of the bus is 13.29 km/kg. Also, the road test results indicated the tractive capabilities and maneuverability of the bus can reach the design specifications.

                  In developing countries, policies for discarding the existing Internal Combustion (IC) Engine vehicles for faster adoption of Electric Vehicles’ not only creates burden on the existing power grid but also is impractical. The conversion of Conventional IC Engine based Online Taxis or public transport vehicles into Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles donor clients, to participate in Vehicle to Grid & Vehicle to Vehicle power transfer model, is the solution. These vehicles would not only have emissions within compliance standards but would also reduces the load on the power grid meanwhile making an income through power transfer. The Intelligent Energy Management System (IEMS) developed makes use of a Non Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) based Pseudo dynamic predictive regulation approach on the powertrain to optimize the emissions, fuel cost and traction battery SoC. If the vehicle intends to participate in power transfer, the IEMS would predetermine the amount of SoC that would be used for an upcoming journey using Global Positioning System(GPS) data interconnected with a server unit which enables the IEMS to optimize the operating conditions of the vehicle. The modelled IEMS performance is tested for a given driving cycle with varying traffic levels on a virtual simulation environment using the IPG CarMaker software.

The SCs provide the required high current peaks and power demands when accelerating the load in the hoisting-up movement. Once the power demand reaches a steady level (hoist up constant speed), the FC provides the energy needed for the rest of the movements. The SCs are also charged when the hoist down movement is taking place. In this case, the regenerative energy can be stored in the SCs instead of being burnt in the braking resistors as in the conventional RTG crane. The new hybrid powertrain based on FC and SCs is designed and evaluated from the real driving cycle of the RTG crane. Simulation results, which include a comparative study with the current configuration of the RTG crane (powered only by diesel engine), demonstrate the technical viability of the RTG crane powered by FC and SCs. This hybrid powertrain is more expensive than the diesel powertrain, but more energy-efficient, and a better solution from the environmental point of view.

                  The well-to-wheels assessment is widely used in the automotive sector to analyze the efficiency and competitiveness of different powertrain/fuel options. The paper proposes a global index that takes into account both the energy and environmental aspects on an uniform basis, through the assignment of the costs associated to the energy and to the pollutant emissions. The European market is analyzed and other pollutants (NOx, PM and SOx) are added to the traditional well-to-wheels evaluations (energy and GHG). The proposed well-to-wheels global index offers a useful place-list that takes into account both energy and environmental aspects and, at the current market conditions, it results that the energy cost prevails (70–85%) over the environmental costs, and among the analyzed external costs, the main contribution is due to the GHG emissions. Natural gas-derived fuels seem to be the most promising. The global index for battery electric vehicle from a European mix are closely linked to the driving range. Conventional biofuels are very critical at present, while significant improvement of the well-to-wheels global index is foreseen for when new generation biofuels will be mature (2030 forecast). In short, even though the proposed global index is not an exhaustive index, it could be a useful tool for decision makers.

                  This work presents a new method to compare energy and environmental performances of five types of urban passenger buses powertrains using a multiphysic index on the basis of a well to wheel analysis. The well to tank step was made for present and future (year 2030) scenarios using different assumptions for the years to come and obtaining various energy and environmental parameters. Additionally, the tank to wheel analysis was performed using dynamic models of vehicles, two different driving cycles and four ranges. Later both stages were integrated in a well to wheel stage where relevant indexes were proposed and discussed. In order to properly asses the different hypotheses for systems, range, cycles and scenarios; a multiphysics indicator (Integrated Sustainability Index), valued between zero and one was used. The best results were achieved by hybrid electric vehicles for short and medium terms. In the long term battery electric vehicles are convenient only for short driving range, while the fuel cell buses yield good performances for more extended driving ranges. For the cleaner powertrains to be competitive, hydrogen production must be fed with clean and renewable energies and the renewable energy share in the electric energy matrix should be considerably high.

                  This research presents an integrated optimal controller to maximize the fuel efficiency of a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) traveling on rolling terrain. The controller optimizes both the vehicle acceleration and the hybrid powertrain operation. It takes advantage of the emerging Connected Vehicle (CV) technology and utilizes present and future information as optimization input, which includes road topography, and dynamic speed limit. The optimal control problem was solved using Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle (PMP). Efforts were made to reduce the computational burden of the optimization process. The evaluation shows that the benefit of the proposed optimal controller is significant compared to regular HEV cruising at the speed limit on rolling terrain. The benefit ranges from 5.0% to 8.9% on mild slopes and from 15.7% to 16.9% on steep slopes. The variation is caused by the change of hilly road density.

                  The current experimental study presents solid (non-volatile) particle number emissions with a size cut-off at 23 nm (SPN23, referred to as PN hereinafter) under real-world driving conditions for 8 passenger cars powered by diesel, gasoline, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and hybrid-electric powertrains. The objective was to identify the highest emitters and assess whether PN focus should be extended to engine and fuel types other than diesel and gasoline direct injection (GDI). Results (under the cold-start RDE-compliant route) show that a Euro 6b gasoline vehicle equipped with port fuel injection (PFI) engine, comprised the highest PN emitter (4.5 times higher than the Euro 6 limit of 6 × 1011 p/km), while similar emission levels (up to 3.7 times higher than this limit) were detected in the older-technology (Euro 3 and 4) gasoline and (retrofitted) LPG PFI vehicles. This limit was also exceeded (by 1.7 times) by one gasoline direct injection (GDI) Euro 6b non-GPF vehicle. PN emissions from the hybrid-electric vehicle (equipped with gasoline PFI engine) were lower than the other Euro 6b PFI vehicle, but still high compared to typical PFI engines found in literature. The lowest emissions were detected in diesel and CNG engines (as low as 7.8 × 109 and 2.4 × 1010 p/km respectively). Euro 6b LPG vehicle was found to be a low emitter (3.3 times lower than the 6 × 1011 p/km limit), while similar emission levels were detected in the other Euro 6b non-GPF GDI vehicle. Among the different driving sections (urban, rural, motorway), urban and especially the cold phase had the highest contribution in most cases. Finally, a significant PN reduction potential was observed with LPG and CNG over gasoline (up to 93% and 90% respectively), although the opposite trend was detected in an old-technology retrofitted LPG vehicle. These results indicate that close attention should be focused on other engine and fuel types, apart from diesel and GDI. Regulatory initiatives towards air pollution reduction should include measures for the reduction of high-emission old-technology gasoline and LPG vehicles, while modern gasoline PFI engines should also be further scrutinized.

                  Concerns over energy efficiency and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are driving research investments into advanced propulsion technologies. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) can provide a bridge that connects transport electrification to renewable bioenergy sources such as ethanol. However, it remains unclear how this pathway can simultaneously address economic, energy and environmental goals. To tackle this challenge, the present study explores, for the first time, the multiobjective optimal sizing of PHEVs powered by low-carbon sources of electricity and ethanol-gasoline blend. The empirical ethanol-gasoline blend model is incorporated into the PHEV simulation whose relevant parameters are validated using laboratory data from the European Commission – Joint Research Centre. We develop a full picture of the use-phase well-to-wheel (WTW) GHG emissions from ethanol, gasoline and grid electricity and their energy consumptions. Consequently, market-oriented PHEV sizing solutions are provided as per the power utility generation portfolio and automobile fuel properties of the target region. The results indicate that better performances of the PHEV, regarding GHG emissions and energy consumption, are associated with larger battery size and smaller engine displacement but result in a higher cost-to-power ratio. Specifically, for E25-fuelled PHEVs in markets with world average electricity carbon intensity, every 1.0 USD/kW increase in cost-to-power ratio leads to savings of 1.6 MJ energy consumption and 1.7 g CO2-eq/km WTW GHG emissions. Moreover, a clear benefit of using E25 in the hybrid propulsion system is identified, where the energy consumption and GHG emissions can be reduced by 5.9% and 12.3%, respectively.

                  The fuel economy of the hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) can be effectively improved by the mode transition (MT). However, for a power-split powertrain whose power-split transmission is directly connected to the engine, the engine ripple torque (ERT), inconsistent dynamic characteristics (IDC) of engine and motors, model estimation inaccuracies (MEI), system parameter uncertainties (SPU) can cause jerk and vibration of transmission system during the MT process, which will reduce the driving comfort and the life of the drive parts. To tackle these problems, a dynamic coordinated control strategy (DCCS), including a staged engine torque feedforward and feedback estimation (ETFBC) and an active damping feedback compensation (ADBC) based on drive shaft torque estimation (DSTE), is proposed. And the effectiveness of this strategy is verified using a plant model. Firstly, the powertrain plant model is established, and the MT process and problems are analyzed. Secondly, considering the characteristics of the engine torque estimation (ETE) model before and after engine ignition, a motor torque compensation control based on the staged ERT estimation is developed. Then, considering the MEI, SPU and the load change, an ADBC based on a real-time nonlinear reduced-order robust observer of the DSTE is designed. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed DCCS can effectively improve the driving comfort.

The main aim of this paper is to show a method to estimate the reliability of an aircraft power system based on a hydrogen fuel cell, mainly for design purposes. The method is based on a high-order adaptive response surface technique, coupled with a dynamic model of the aircraft power system, and it is applied to the failure event represented by an incorrect power supply due to the failure of sensors of the control system of the powertrain. The most important advantage of the proposed method is the low computational effort it requires. The result is a ranking of the most critical sensors to be considered in the design phase of the power system and demonstrate that accurate temperature sensors and sensor calibration are of dramatic importance for the control of the stack power, in case of powertrain based on PEM fuel cell systems.

                  In a truck platoon, a smaller inter-vehicle gap reduces aerodynamic drag, which is beneficial for energy savings, but can also elevate the risk of crashing against the lead vehicle. Therefore, a reasonable speed for the following truck should be planned to balance safety and energy consumption. Moreover, for hybrid electric trucks, optimizing the power split among different energy sources also contributes to energy savings. Following distance and power distribution are therefore coupled. To achieve cost savings in a hybrid truck following situation, a co-optimization should be performed on speed planning and power split to achieve an optimal trade-off between safety, drag reduction, and energy consumption. In this paper, such an approach is developed and analyzed. Model predictive control is adopted to implement the optimization strategy. Real-world speed profiles are used to assess the proposed method, and the results demonstrate that the coordinated control method outperforms a manual following strategy by flexibly tuning the following distance, resulting in cost savings of about 5.2%.

                  Fuel-Cell System (FCS) is the primary energy supply of a Fuel-Cell Vehicle (FCV). Battery or Ultra-Capacitor (UC), as a secondary power source, is used along the FCS to improve the FCV’s power response. Battery and UC composition, as a hybrid power source presenting the term of Fuel-Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicle (FCHEV), provides the FCV with the advantages of high energy density and high dynamic response. The supervisory system of the FCHEV could be managed efficiently to exploit the benefits of battery and UC at the same time. As a matter of fact, in such a combination, the performance of the hybrid powertrain largely depends on how to distribute the requested power through different types of energy sources.
                  In this paper, we design the powertrain elements of an FCHEV in advance, with FCS/Battery/UC considerations. The energy management strategy (EMS) is achieved by presenting a novel power sharing method and by implementing an intelligent control technique constructed based on Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC). The control parameters are accurately adjusted by the genetic algorithm (GA) while considering targets and restrictions within a multi-objective optimization function over a combined city/highway driving cycle. This optimized supervisory system is examined by Advanced Vehicle Simulator (ADVISOR) to evaluate the performance of the proposed EMS over 22 different driving cycles and some specific performance tests. The results of simulation show that the presented strategy progressively affects the vehicle characteristics. Fuel economy enhancement, vehicle performance improvement, battery charge-sustaining capability, and optimal energy distribution are some of the significant outcomes achieved by the optimized FLC-based EMS.

                  In this study a hydrogen powered fuel cell hybrid bus is optimized in terms of the powertrain components and in terms of the energy management strategy. Firstly the vehicle is optimized aiming to minimize the cost of its powertrain components, in an official driving cycle. The optimization variables in powertrain component design are different models and sizes of fuel cells, of electric motors and controllers, and batteries. After the component design, an energy management strategy (EMS) optimization is performed in the official driving cycle and in two real measured driving cycles, aiming to minimize the fuel consumption. The EMS optimization is based on the control of the battery’s state-of-charge. The real driving cycles are representative of bus driving in urban routes within Lisbon and Oporto Portuguese cities. A real-coded genetic algorithm is developed to perform the optimization, and linked with the vehicle simulation software ADVISOR. The trade-off between cost increase and fuel consumption reduction is discussed in the lifetime of the designed bus and compared to a conventional diesel bus. Although the cost of the optimized hybrid powertrain (62,230€) achieves 9 times the cost of a conventional diesel bus, the improved efficiency of such powertrain achieved 36% and 34% of lower energy consumption for the real driving cycles, OportoDC and LisbonDC, which can originate savings of around 0.43€/km and 0.37€/km respectively. The optimization methodology presented in this work, aside being an offline method, demonstrated great improvements in performance and energy consumption in real driving cycles, and can be a great advantage in the design of a hybrid vehicle.

However, as a consequence of lower energy density in widely adopted electrochemical energy source-battery, the driving range per charge presents a major barrier for electric vehicle's large-scale commercialization. Additionally, the limited battery life and extra costs associated with its replacement are other negative factors that hinder the development of electric vehicle. Currently, the one-speed gearbox is dominant in electric vehicles' market though it is only a trade-off between manufacturing cost and vehicle performance. Therefore, multi-speed electrified powertrains have been proposed and investigated in this paper to pursue the improvement of energy efficiency and dynamic performance without increasing battery size. In addition, supercapacitor, as the supplementary to battery, is combined with multi-speed transmissions to improve driving range and battery life. The combination of two advanced technologies are investigated in both B and E-class electric vehicle. Results demonstrate that considerable benefits attained for both small and large passenger vehicles through the application of multi-speed transmissions. The effectiveness of hybrid energy storage system in protecting battery from damage is verified. The relationship of hybrid energy storage system and multi-speed transmission is reported.

                  This work evaluates the performance and emissions of the series hybrid vehicle concept powered by a gasoline partially premixed internal combustion engine. To do so, experimental data was collected from a Volvo VED-D4 Euro 6 four-cylinder compression ignition engine running under gasoline partially premixed combustion. Two series hybrid vehicle models were developed in GT-Power®, which were fed with the experimental data to evaluate the potential of the hybrid concept. First of all, the battery charging strategy of the hybrid vehicles was optimized in terms of number of power levels and operating conditions. For this, a design of experiments was performed in GT-Power®, which enabled to obtain a predictive model of the performance and emissions. The predictive model was used to obtain the optimized NOx-fuel consumption Pareto frontiers for each charging strategy proposed. Finally, the GT-Power® vehicle models were run with the optimal operating conditions (selected from each Pareto) in both the new European driving cycle and worldwide harmonized light vehicles test cycle. The results show that the hybrid powertrain running with partially premixed combustion is able to achieve similar or better performance than the commercial diesel vehicle with low engine-out emissions. Moreover, comparing the results from both vehicles, it was confirmed that the hybridization results in better improvements when applied to urban traffic than for highway conditions where the power request is higher and the potential for regenerative braking is reduced.

Based on the mathematic model, a power control principle is designed, which uses full-states closed-loop feedback algorithm. To implement full-states feedback, a Luenberger state observer is designed to estimate open circuit voltage (OCV) of the battery, which make the control principle not sensitive to the battery SOC (state of charge) estimated error. Full-states feedback controller is then designed through analyzing step responding of the powertrain and test data. At last of the paper, the results of simulation and field test are illustrated.

                  With ever growing concerns on energy crises and environmental issues, Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell is favored in automotive applications because it is clean, efficient and low noise. A fuel cell hybrid powertrain is composed of a fuel cell system as the primary power source, a battery as the secondary power source and an electric motor. In order to improve the reliability, a distributed control system that can be preserved even under faulty cases is necessary. This paper presents an active fault tolerance control system (AFTCS) for a fuel cell/battery hybrid powertrain applied to a city bus. The AFTCS consists of a system for fault detection and diagnose and a reconfigurable controller. Algorithms to detect and isolated three kinds of important faults are introduced. The real-time applicable reconfigurable controller is exploited to recover the pre-fault system performance as much as possible. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed system.

                  This paper presents the multiple energy storage system usability for an electric motorcycle focused on passive hybrid topology. The studied hybridization is based on a passive parallel topology connecting lithium manganese nickel 18650-type cells and lithium-ion-capacitor to supply the motorcycle powertrain. The passive hybrid energy storage system design is fully addressed based on an extension of Ns/Np battery pack sizing maps to passive hybrid topology using lithium-ion-batteries and lithium-ion-capacitors. The improved sizing method is able to size simultaneously an integrated energy storage system made from two different cells chemistries. The proposed design optimizes the common voltage range and distribute the current according to the intrinsic cells characteristics. Relationship between dimensions are established to plot as a traditional two-dimensional map a four-dimension sizing problem. The benefits and performance improvements obtained by the Ns/Np hybrid design for a case study involving an electric motorcycle are presented and discussed based on root-mean-square and mean value of the current cell, standard deviation of the C-rate and instantaneous current peaks variation coefficient. The proposed configuration could reduce the stress on the battery cells by 42% on standard deviation and 36% on variation coefficient with a decrease of 9% in average current while reducing the root-mean square value by 15% on a specific motorbike race simulation.

                  This paper introduces a new energy management (EM) strategy for series hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Series HEVs operate in charge-depletion mode and then switch to the charge-sustaining mode in which the battery state of charge (SOC) is maintained within a certain range. The proposed EM strategy in this paper is a form of adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) that is designed for the charge-sustaining mode. The EM strategy defines soft bounds on the battery SOC and is penalized for exceeding these bounds. But, to catch energy-saving opportunities (CESOs), the EM strategy allows SOC to exceed the soft bounds. Thus, the introduced EM strategy is named ECMS-CESO. In addition, a range for the ECMS optimal equivalent factor is proposed for series HEVs. The proposed range is used in deriving the formula for calculating the adaptive equivalent factor. The main advantage of the proposed EM strategy is that ECMS-CESO can achieve close to optimal fuel economy without the need for predicting future driver demand. Since there is no need for prediction, the intensive calculations for finding the optimal control over the prediction horizon can be eliminated. Therefore, implementation of ECMS-CESO is easily feasible for real-time applications. Experimental powertrain data is collected to develop a powertrain model for a series HEV in this study. Simulation results on several drivecycles show that, on average, the fuel economy achieved by ECMS-CESO is within 6% of the maximum fuel economy. In addition, comparing ECMS-CESO with two existing adaptive ECMSs shows up to 5% improvement in fuel economy, on average.

Such an activity is motivated by the positive impact of car electrification on transportation related GHG emissions, and by the potential of hydrogen as an intensive energy carrier to avoid heavy battery packs, as required for pure electric cars. Moreover, the availability of reliable and comprehensive mathematical tools is recognized as a key to develop cost effective and highly performing innovative powertrains.
                  A database of hybridizing devices' costs and weights is developed and exploited in conjunction with a weight model to size the powertrain as a function of degree of hybridization. In parallel, a versatile heuristic control strategy is proposed to easily adapt control rules to different powertrains. Then, both the weight model and the heuristic control strategy are embedded into an optimization procedure to determine the most convenient PEM fuel cell hybrid vehicle configuration.

It is shown that the operating cost strictly decreases with increasing battery and supercapacitor sizes. In addition, simulation results show that the operating cost is reduced by up to 28.6% when compared to a conventional hybrid powertrain without supercapacitors. Thus the effectiveness of adopting supercapacitors in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles is verified.

Next in online part, the current driving condition is real-time identified by a well-trained support vector machine, and Markov chains-based driving behaviors are accordingly selected. With the stochastic inputs, stochastic receding horizon control method is adopted to obtain the optimized energy management of hybrid powertrain. Simulations and hardware-in-loop test are carried out with the real-world city bus route, and the results show that the presented strategy could greatly improve the vehicle fuel economy, and as the traffic flow data feedback increases, the fuel consumption of every plug-in hybrid electric bus running in a specific bus route tends to be a stable minimum.

                  A Full Hybrid Electric Vehicle (FHEV) has been proposed with a single motor based on Dual Clutch Transmissions (DCT), which can take the advantage of the distinctive HEV structure and advantages of DCT. The dynamic model of hybrid system has been established taking the characteristics of engine, ISG motor and clutches into consideration. The working modes of the FHEV have been designed based on the optimal system efficiency and the shift schedule for the best economy has also been proposed. As a result, the integrated working mode and shift schedule of the FHEV has been achieved. Due to the mode transition and shifting of the FHEV maybe happen at the same time, the coordinated control strategy has been proposed to implement the mode transition and shifting simultaneously, which can solve the conflict between mode transition and DCT shifting. Simulation model of coordinated control of mode transition and shifting has been established based on Matlab/Simulink platform. The simulation results indicate that the control strategy proposed in this paper is effective to solve the conflict between mode transition and DCT shifting. Furthermore, comparing with mode transition and shifting sequentially, the duration of mode transition and shifting are greatly shortened and the repeated operation of power sources and actuators are also avoided. It also shows that the coordinated control strategy can take advantage of the FHEV equipped with DCT.

The power management strategy is derived by the application of the Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle, where the control parameter is adapted by using feedback information on the state of charge and total trip length forecast as a function of a moving average of past information about the driving cycle speed. The strategy we propose aims at achieving a real time sub-optimal solution of the control problem which is cast into the minimization of the consumed fuel. The vehicle is also equipped by an auto-thermal reformer and, in order to minimize the hydrogen buffer size, the control algorithm is subject to constraints on the maximum hydrogen buffer level.

                  A novel multimode power-split hybrid electric vehicle demonstrates significant advantages in energy conservation. The complicated structure and multiple operation modes, however, have brought significant challenges to energy management. The problems of operation mode selection, power allocation, and operating point selection need to be solved simultaneously. Traditionally, existing energy management strategies first have determined operation mode and then have solved power allocation and operating points. Moreover, traditional dynamic programming usually has not considered electric energy consumption and has deviated from the optimal solution. To solve these problems, a cascaded energy management strategy that integrates dynamic programming and equivalent consumption minimization strategy (DP + ECMS) is proposed. An iterative method is used to optimize the equivalence factor. A vehicle model based on actual control strategy is established and validated by test results. Then fuel economy simulations are conducted. Results showed that DP + ECMS could achieve 19.9% fuel economy improvement compared with the rule-based strategy for a new European driving cycle. In addition, simulation results of a Worldwide Harmonized Light-Duty Test Cycle demonstrated that DP + ECMS performed well in real road driving conditions. This study introduces a novel multimode power-split hybrid system and provides a global energy management optimization method.

                  This paper investigates a model-free supervisory control methodology with double Q-learning for the hybrid vehicle in charge-sustaining scenarios. It aims to improve the vehicle’s energy efficiency continuously while maintaining the battery’s state-of-charge in real-world driving. Two new heuristic action execution policies, the max-value-based policy and the random policy, are proposed for the double Q-learning method to reduce overestimation of the merit-function values for each action in power-split control of the vehicle. Experimental studies based on software-in-the-loop (offline learning) and hardware-in-the-loop (online learning) platforms are carried out to explore the potential of energy-saving in four driving cycles defined with real-world vehicle operations. The results from 35 rounds of offline undisturbed learning show that the heuristic action execution policies can improve the learning performance of conventional double Q-learning by achieving at least 1.09% higher energy efficiency. The proposed methods achieve similar results obtained by dynamic programming, but they have the capability of real-time online application. Double Q-learnings are shown more robust to turbulence during the disturbed learning: they realise at least three times improvement in energy efficiency compared to the standard Q-learning. Random execution policy achieves 1.18% higher energy efficiency than the max-value-based policy for the same driving condition. Significant tests show that deciding factor in the random execution policy has little impact on learning performance. By implementing the control strategies for online learning, the proposed model-free control method can save energy by more than 4.55% in the predefined real-world driving conditions compared to the method using standard Q-learning.

In the literature, there are several relevant published works which focus on this topic for developed countries, and other countries, such as Brazil are not fully investigated; therefore this gap was a motivation for this study. The methods consider the fuel production, electricity generation and powertrain production, the vehicle use phase stages and powertrain end of life only, which includes the recycling of vehicles and batteries. The goal and scope of this study is to evaluate and to compare the environmental impacts of vehicles in the Brazilian context. A life cycle assessment is carried out in this paper to assess the well-to-wheels for different scenarios of fuels consumption and powertrains configurations for a vehicle. The five analyzed scenarios are: conventional internal combustion engine vehicle fuelled by gasoline, conventional internal combustion engine vehicle fuelled by hydrous ethanol, conventional internal combustion engine vehicle fuelled by a mixture of gasoline and hydrous ethanol (flex-fuel vehicle), plug-in hybrid electric vehicle and battery electric vehicle. The common functional unit assumed for the analysis was 1.0 km traveled. The results show that the scenarios that use ethanol as fuel have higher environmental impacts for the categories of acidification, eutrophication and photochemical oxidation. The scenarios using gasoline have the higher impacts for abiotic depletion, fossil fuels abiotic depletion potential and global warming potential. Vehicles using lithium ions batteries have the highest impacts for human toxicity. The battery electric vehicle has smallest environmental impacts in general way, followed by vehicles using ethanol. The Brazilian government should increase its investment and develop the use of electric vehicles, since the country's electric mix is renewable, as well as further encourage the use of ethanol, since it generates less environmental impacts than gasoline.

This paper describes both the design and the optimization of an environmentally friendly hybrid bus (hereafter referred to as “HYBUS”) for urban public transportation.
                  After a preliminary description of the main features of the hybrid architecture, this paper assessed, through numerical simulations, the fuel economy potential of the hybridization in real world driving conditions. The promising results of this first part of the study led to the development of a first prototype.
                  The first prototype of the bus was built by integrating an innovative hybrid propulsion system featuring a plug-in series architecture into the chassis of an old IVECO 490 TURBOCITY. The bus is 12m long and capable to host up to 116 passengers in the original layout. The project relied on a modular approach where the powertrain could be easily customized for size and power, depending on the specific application.
                  The prototype was then extensively tested in the city of Genoa, Italy, an urban context extremely challenging for a hybrid powertrain due to its frequent uphill routes and significant road grades. The outcomes of the test campaign confirmed the simulations forecasts, and fostered additional analysis aimed to optimize the energy management strategy of the hybrid powertrain.
                  Numerical simulations were then used in order to identify more refined energy management strategies capable of further enhancing the fuel economy potential of the hybrid architecture. Consequently, a novel energy management was developed, and virtually tested, to manage the HYBUS in a more effective way. The results demonstrated the interesting potential of such hybrid architecture.
               ","inable mobility has fostered the introduction of innovative propulsion systems also in the public transport sector in order to achieve a significant reduction of pollutant emissions in highly congested urban areas. This paper describes both the design and the optimization of an environmentally friendly hybrid bus (hereafter referred to as “HYBUS”) for urban public transportation.

                  Lithium-ion battery degradation is one of the most important issues in hybrid electric vehicles. In order to minimize degradation and its equivalent battery life cost, the degradation of Li-ion batteries needs to be considered in energy management strategies. The existing methods mainly consider the battery aging in energy management strategies while ignoring its thermal dynamics. This paper proposes a battery aging- and temperature-aware predictive energy management strategy for parallel hybrid electric vehicles. This method is developed based on model predictive control (MPC) and evaluated in the scenario of urban bus transportation. First, due to the stochastic nature of speed transitions under actual driving conditions, a stochastic speed predictor is built based on the Markov chain model. Then, an optimal control framework for energy management strategy (EMS) is developed based on MPC, and the battery electrical-thermal-aging dynamics are considered in this control framework. The optimization is performed on the receding horizon using Pontryagin's minimization principle (PMP). The newly developed PMP-based MPC method is compared with the rule-based method and the global optimization method. The comparisons show that the PMP method is superior to dynamic programming when the battery electrical-thermal-aging dynamics are considered in the EMS development, and also show that the battery temperature-aware EMS can lower the total energy consumption.

                  To improve fuel economy and reduce online computation time and microprocessor hardware resources, a real-time implementable energy management strategy for a dual-mode power-split hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) based on an explicit model predictive control (EMPC) method is proposed in this paper. The proposed strategy includes an accurate control-oriented model and a dynamic process coordination control algorithm. The energy management optimal control problem is formulated as a multiparameter quadratic programming optimization problem, and the EMPC control laws are obtained by solving the multiparameter quadratic programming problem offline. The laws are then used online to realize real-time control. A traditional model predictive control (MPC)-based control strategy, DP-based control strategy and rule-based control strategy are considered benchmark strategies for verification of the proposed EMPC-based energy management strategy. The simulation results indicate the EMPC controller has far lower microprocessor hardware costs than the MPC controller but equivalent control performance. As the prediction horizon increases, fuel consumption remains nearly the same between the MPC-based control strategy and EMPC-based control strategy. The consumption time of the MPC-based control strategy increases significantly, while the consumption time of the EMPC-based control strategy is nearly unchanged. Compared with the benchmark algorithms, the elapsed time of the EMPC controller maximum reduced by 97.46%, and the fuel economy improved by 23.37%.

                  The paper presents a methodology and an analysis applied to a real-life dataset, which refer to an extended period that lasted more than one year, pertaining to trips undertaken in Europe by more than one thousand vehicles. The results in this paper are an example of the detailed information that can be extracted from rough data to support the decisions of stakeholders and final users (e.g. car makers, authorities, drivers), as well as to understand which road vehicle features will be able to comply with the observed daily usage of automobiles.
                  The main scope of the paper has been to focus on variables concerning the duration and lengths of trips, the idle times, and the energy consumed by engines. These variables have been correlated and compared with the current and expected hybrid and electric ranges of autonomy, as constrained by the present and next generation of electric batteries, both in terms of autonomy and time required for their recharging. Therefore, the aim of the study has been to find answers to the following research question: considering the daily mileage, actual fuel consumption and idle time structure, can hybrid and electric powertrains represent adequate alternatives to traditional engines, considering the present battery ranges and charging alternatives?
                  Long distance trips have been analysed in detail to obtain a better understanding of whether they can be covered by electric cars in the same ways as they are with those based on internal combustion engines. In the extensive sample that has been analysed, in order to satisfy 99,9% of the daily trips, it would be necessary to raise the range to 400 km. This target could be reached by adopting a PHEV (plug-in) or a full-electric car with an equivalent range. This study provides a quantitative analysis of the energy needs, obtained over a wide range of usage of road vehicles, and attempts to correlate them with the opportunities of recovering energy during the idle time detected over real-life 24h driving cycles, assuming the availability of intermediate charges.

The controller was designed by using neural networks (NN), which were trained with the optimal power flux distribution between a fuel cell system and a battery system that minimizes the overall equivalent energy consumption. The optimal solution was obtained by carrying out a gradient-based method minimization over eight different driving cycles, and using a dynamic lumped parameter mathematical model of a FCHEV fed by hydrogen and Li-ion batteries. A quantitative and qualitative analysis was made showing the networks performances over different type of cycles. Through this analysis, a suitable classification into two cycle categories is provided, covering most of the possible driving styles with two of the developed controllers.

Benefits in using hybrid powertrains are generally found in urban environment where lower average speeds, higher accelerations make the internal combustion engine run at lower efficiency points. The originality of the present paper consists in the data elaboration and analysis collected in a measurement campaign on road in real driving conditions, on an ad hoc path planned according to the average national daily mileage in metropolitan urban context, which thus acquires a significance generalizable in that specific context, which led to the consumption quantification and an analysis of the main factors that determine the reduction in consumption of full-hybrid vs conventional vehicles. Another important and original aspect of this paper is the analysis of the operating times in ZEV mode of hybrid vehicles, which shows how this solution leads to a significant reduction of pollutant emissions in urban contest. An on-road experimental campaign has been done by comparing two different versions of the same model (Toyota Yaris Hybrid and a conventional one, Toyota Yaris 1.5 gasoline) and a hybrid vehicle with different characteristics (the hybrid born - Toyota Prius), like size, traction battery capacity, generator/motor electric power. Thirty drivers on a fixed path have done this experimental campaign and in this paper, the results are reported. The results show that a strong influence on consumption is due not only to the type of vehicle, but also to driving style and speed. The comparison between the two versions of Yaris, shows a strong reduction in consumption using hybrid vehicle for low and medium speeds (for 20 km/h about 50%), such benefit decreases with the increasing speed and for values higher than 90 km/h both the vehicles have the same consumption. The reduced consumption of the hybrid vehicle at low speeds is due, on the one hand, to the greater efficiency of the hybrid vehicle engine compared to the conventional one and on the other hand to the high functioning in ZEV mode, with the engine off, (63% of time) thanks to the use of the electric motor. The comparison between the two hybrid vehicles with different characteristics (YarisHy and Prius) shows that the consumption trend vs. speeds is similar but the Prius has lower consumption due above all to the high efficiency of the braking energy recovery system, despite the greatest mass. This lead then to significant consumption reduction, but also lower emissions in places where such parameters have an important role: the urban environment.","prove efficiency and reduce CO2 production of vehicles.

The originality of the present paper consists in the data elaboration and analysis collected in a measurement campaign on road in real driving conditions, on an ad hoc path planned according to the average national daily mileage in metropolitan urban context, which thus acquires a significance generalizable in that specific context, which led to the consumption quantification and an analysis of the main factors that determine the reduction in consumption of full-hybrid vs conventional vehicles. Another important and original aspect of this paper is the analysis of the operating times in ZEV mode of hybrid vehicles, which shows how this solution leads to a significant reduction of pollutant emissions in urban contest. An on-road experimental campaign has been done by comparing two different versions of the same model (Toyota Yaris Hybrid and a conventional one, Toyota Yaris 1.5 gasoline) and a hybrid vehicle with different characteristics (the hybrid born - Toyota Prius), like size, traction battery capacity, generator/motor electric power. Thirty drivers on a fixed path have done this experimental campaign and in this paper, the results are reported. The results show that a strong influence on consumption is due not only to the type of vehicle, but also to driving style and speed. The comparison between the two versions of Yaris, shows a strong reduction in consumption using hybrid vehicle for low and medium speeds (for 20 km/h about 50%), such benefit decreases with the increasing speed and for values higher than 90 km/h both the vehicles have the same consumption. The reduced consumption of the hybrid vehicle at low speeds is due, on the one hand, to the greater efficiency of the hybrid vehicle engine compared to the conventional one and on the other hand to the high functioning in ZEV mode, with the engine off, (63% of time) thanks to the use of the electric motor. The comparison between the two hybrid vehicles with different characteristics (YarisHy and Prius) shows that the consumption trend vs. speeds is similar but the Prius has lower consumption due above all to the high efficiency of the braking energy recovery system, despite the greatest mass. This lead then to significant consumption reduction, but also lower emissions in places where such parameters have an important role: the urban environment.","prove efficiency reduce co2 production vehicle . benefit using hybrid powertrains generally found urban environment lower average speed , higher acceleration make internal combustion engine run lower efficiency point . originality present paper consists data elaboration analysis collected measurement campaign road real driving condition , ad hoc path planned according average national daily mileage metropolitan urban context , thus acquires significance generalizable specific context , led consumption quantification analysis main factor determine reduction consumption full-hybrid v conventional vehicle . another important original aspect paper analysis operating time zev mode hybrid vehicle , show solution lead significant reduction pollutant emission urban contest . on-road experimental campaign done comparing two different version model ( toyota yaris hybrid conventional one , toyota yaris 1.5 gasoline ) hybrid vehicle different characteristic ( hybrid born - toyota prius ) , like size , traction battery capacity , generator/motor electric power . thirty driver fixed path done experimental campaign paper , result reported . result show strong influence consumption due type vehicle , also driving style speed . comparison two version yaris , show strong reduction consumption using hybrid vehicle low medium speed ( 20 km/h 50 % ) , benefit decrease increasing speed value higher 90 km/h vehicle consumption . reduced consumption hybrid vehicle low speed due , one hand , greater efficiency hybrid vehicle engine compared conventional one hand high functioning zev mode , engine , ( 63 % time ) thanks use electric motor . comparison two hybrid vehicle different characteristic ( yarishy prius ) show consumption trend vs. speed similar prius lower consumption due high efficiency braking energy recovery system , despite greatest mass . lead significant consumption reduction , also lower emission place parameter important role : urban environment .

                  Energy management strategies have been proven to be instrumental in fully realizing the potential of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). This paper proposes an improved adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (IA-ECMS). In an IA-ECMS, the equivalence factor (EF) can be tuned in real time due to integration with the results of the vehicle-environment cooperative control. This study’s main contributions are twofold. First, a novel A-ECMS is developed, in which the EF tuning method is carefully designed based on the results of a correlation study. The study results reveal that EF is determined by the future driving behaviour and the current component status. To ascertain the future driving behaviour, a method based on participatory sensing data (PSD) is used to implement the vehicle-environment cooperative control. Second, a comparative study of the IA-ECMS and the energy management strategy based on the existing model of predictive control (MPC) is performed. The comparison results show that the application process of the IA-ECMS is similar to that of the MPC-based method except for two main differences. The simulation results demonstrate that the presented IA-ECMS approach could outperform in fuel economy the conventional A-ECMS (CA-ECMS) method.

                  With a compound power-split transmission directly connected to the engine in hybrid cars, dramatic fluctuations in engine output torque result in noticeable jerks when the car is in mode transition from electric drive mode to hybrid drive mode. This study designed a mode transition coordinated control strategy, and verified that strategy’s effectiveness with both simulations and experiments. Firstly, the mode transition process was analyzed, and ride comfort issues during the mode transition process were demonstrated. Secondly, engine ripple torque was modeled using the measured cylinder pumping pressure when the engine was not in operation. The complete dynamic plant model of the power-split hybrid car was deduced, and its effectiveness was validated by a comparison of experimental and simulation results. Thirdly, a coordinated control strategy was designed to determine the desired engine torque, motor torque, and the moment of fuel injection. Active damping control with two degrees of freedom, based on reference output shaft speed estimation, was designed to mitigate driveline speed oscillations. Carrier torque estimation based on transmission kinematics and dynamics was used to suppress torque disturbance during engine cranking. The simulation and experimental results indicate that the proposed strategy effectively suppressed vehicle jerks and improved ride comfort during mode transition.

                  The present study has focused on the refinement of a previously developed tool for the optimization of the layout of hybrid electric vehicles and on its application to a newly proposed non-plug in parallel hybrid vehicle, which has been equipped with a planetary gear set and a single-speed gearbox positioned between a compression ignition engine and a permanent magnet electric machine. This vehicle is capable of torque-coupling and speed-coupling between the engine and the electric machine, and for this reason has been referred to as a “dual-mode vehicle”.
                  The tool performs a bi-level (nested) coupling of design and control strategy optimization, and is able to identify the optimal design of each hybrid vehicle by minimizing the powertrain costs over a 10-year time span. The vehicle design determines the size of battery, engine and electric machine, as well as the values of the speed ratio of each power coupling device. Different powertrain cost definitions, which account for the production costs of the components and the operating costs related to fuel consumption and battery depletion over the lifetime of the vehicle, have been proposed. The latter cost contribution depends directly on the control strategy adopted to manage the power flow between the electric machine and the engine, as well as on the selection of the transmission gear. The optimal control strategy has been identified using a specifically developed fast running dynamic programming-based optimizer, which minimizes an objective function over a given training driving mission.
                  The performance of the dual-mode vehicle with the optimal layout has been investigated in detail over several driving missions and compared with that of more traditional hybrid vehicles equipped with either a speed coupling device or with a torque coupling device, as well as with a conventional reference vehicle.
                  Moreover, several sensitivity analyses have been carried out in order to investigate the impact of the cost definition, of the objective function and of the training driving mission on the powertrain design and on its performance (fuel economy, pollutant emissions, battery management).
                  Finally, different market scenarios have been explored, in terms of fuel price, battery life and battery cost, and their effects on the identification of the optimal design, as well as on the performance of the resulting vehicles, have been analyzed.

                  To advance eco-driving skills in hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) drivers, and thus facilitate fuel efficient driving behavior, a set of 15 ecodriving-tips was developed and tested. In part 1, car owner manuals and telephone interviews with HEV expert ecodrivers were analyzed to extract ecodriving-related statements. As the owner manual statements were too generic to be used for the content generation of the ecodriving-tips, only their style was used for formulation purposes at a later stage. The interview statements were used for the content generation, and thus condensed into a concise set of 15 ecodriving-tips. This set was then formulated in three versions. Version 1 was based on the “no context, no details” formulation style extracted from the owner manuals. Version 2 and 3 were psychologically-grounded: Version 2 was based on the concept of implementation intentions, and therefore contained “if-then-plans”. For Version 3, these “if-then-plans” were coupled with technical explanations to additionally target the improvement of drivers’ mental models. Eventually, to ensure technical correctness, all three versions were reviewed by a HEV powertrain expert. In part 2, a longitudinal field study with two points of measurement was conducted to test the three versions in a randomized controlled design. For this, HEV drivers were recruited and randomly assigned to one of three groups. At baseline, each group received and evaluated a different version of the ecodriving-tips and was then asked to test the tips over the next 31 days. At follow-up, all groups, again, evaluated the ecodriving-tips. At both points of measurement self-reported fuel consumption was assessed. To sum up, 81 participants evaluated the tips as largely positive, both at baseline and follow-up. Furthermore, participants who received Version 3 of the ecodriving-tips (implementation intentions and technical explanations) significantly reduced their fuel consumption by 4% on average over time.

                  This paper proposes a novel control framework and the corresponding strategy for power sources management in connected plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (cPHEVs). A mobile edge computation (MEC) based control framework is developed first, evolving the conventional on-board vehicle control unit (VCU) into the hierarchically asynchronous controller that is partly located in cloud. Elaborately contrastive analysis on the performance of processing capacity, communication frequency and communication delay manifests dramatic potential of the proposed framework in sustaining development of the cooperative control strategy for cPHEVs. On the basis of MEC based control framework, a specific cooperative strategy is constructed. The novel strategy accomplishes energy flow management between different power sources with incorporation of the active energy consumption plan and adaptive energy consumption management. The method to generate the reference battery state-of-charge (SOC) trajectories in energy consumption plan stage is emphatically investigated, fast outputting reference trajectories that are tightly close to results by global optimization methods. The estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) is employed to output reference control policies under the specific terminal conditions assigned via the machine learning based method. Finally, simulation results highlight that the novel strategy attains superior performance in real-time application that is close to the offline global optimization solutions.

                  In the global attempt to increase the powertrain overall efficiency of hybrid vehicles while reducing the battery size, engine waste heat recovery (WHR) systems are nowadays promising technologies. This is in particular interesting for series hybrid electric vehicles (SHEV), as the engine operates at a relative high load and under steady conditions. Therefore, the resulting high exhaust gas temperature presents the advantage of increased WHR efficiency. The Brayton cycle offers a relatively reduced weight compared to other WHR systems and presents a low complexity for integration in vehicles since it relies on an open system architecture with air as the working fluid, which consequently avoids the need for a condenser compared to the Rankine cycle. This paper investigates the potential of fuel consumption savings of a SHEV using the Brayton cycle as a WHR system from the internal combustion engine (ICE) exhaust gases. An exergy analysis is conducted on the simple Brayton cycle and several Brayton waste heat recovery (BWHR) systems were identified. A SHEV with ICE-BWHR systems is modeled, where the recovered engine waste heat is converted into electricity using an electric generator and stored in the vehicle battery. The energy consumption simulations is performed on the worldwide-harmonized light-vehicles test cycle (WLTC) while considering the additional weight of the BWHR systems. The intercooled Brayton cycle (IBC) architecture is identified as the most promising for automotive applications as it offers the most convenient compromise between high efficiency and low integration complexity. Results show that 5.5% and 7.0% improved fuel economy on plug-in and self-sustaining SHEV configurations respectively when compared to similar vehicle configurations with ICE auxiliary power units. In addition to the fuel economy improvements, the IBC-WHR system offers other intrinsic advantages such as low noise, low vibration, high durability which makes it a potential heat recovery system for integration in SHEV.

The mobile edge computation units (MECUs) and the on-board vehicle control units (VCUs) are included as the distributed controllers, which enable vehicle-environment cooperative control and reduce the computation intensity on the vehicle by transferring partial work from VCUs to MECUs. On this basis, a novel cooperative control strategy is designed to successively achieve the energy management planned by the iterative dynamic programming (IDP) in MECUs and the energy utilization management achieved by the model predictive control (MPC) algorithm in the VCU. The performance of raised control strategy is validated by simulation analysis, highlighting that the cooperative control strategy can achieve superior performance in real-time application that is close to the global optimization results solved offline.

                  This paper proposes a hierarchical optimization energy management strategy to suppress the battery aging in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. In the first-level, a variable-threshold dynamic programming algorithm to distribute the power between the energy storage system and the engine is proposed. By adding supercapacitor to form the hybrid energy storage system, and using adaptive low-pass filtering algorithm, the power between the battery and the supercapacitor is distributed. To control the supercapacitor and battery to work within the capacity range, a power limits management module for redistributing the power between the engine, the supercapacitor and the battery is considered. The adaptive low-pass filtering algorithm and power limits management module constitute adaptive power allocation method in the second-level. After that, the rain-flow counting algorithm is applied in this paper to calculate battery aging cost. By using the rain-flow counting algorithm, the battery performances are analyzed, and the results show that the adaptive power allocation method can improve the battery service life by about 54.9% compared with the global dynamic programming algorithm. Considering the initial cost of the supercapacitor, the costs of battery aging, fuel consumption, electricity consumption, and management cost of retired batteries, compared with the global dynamic programming algorithm, the life cycle economy of the vehicle is improved by 12.4% under the proposed method.

                  Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is one of the most promising products to solve the problem about air pollution and energy crisis. Considering the characteristics of urban bus route, maybe a fixed-control-parameter control strategy for PHEV cannot perfectly match the complicated variation of driving conditions, and as a result the ideal vehicle fuel economy would not be obtained. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop an adaptive real-time optimal energy management strategy for PHEV by taking the segment characteristics of driving cycles into consideration. In this study, a novel energy management strategy for Plug-in hybrid electric bus (PHEB) is proposed, which optimizes the equivalent factor (EF) of each segment in the driving cycle. The proposed strategy includes an offline part and an online part. In the offline part, the driving cycles are divided into segments according to the actual positions of bus stops, the EF of each segment is optimized by linear weight particle swarm optimization algorithm with different initial states of charge (SOC). The optimization results of EF are then converted into a 2-dimensional look up table, which can be used to make real-time adjustments to online control strategy. In the online part, the optimal instantaneous energy distribution is obtained in this hybrid powertrain. Finally, the proposed strategy is verified with simulation and hardware in the loop tests, and three kinds of commonly used control strategies are adopted for comparison. Results show when the initial SOC is 90%, the fuel economy with the proposed strategy can be improved by 15.93% compared with that of baseline strategy, and when the initial SOC is 60%, this value is 16.02%. The proposed strategy may provide theoretical support for control optimization of PHEV.

                  Hybrid electric tracked bulldozers use engine and ultracapacitor as the power sources for propulsion, and the fuel economy performance highly depend on the coordination of all subsystems. In this paper, a model predictive controller is developed to reduce the fuel consumption of hybrid electric tracked bulldozers. As an optimization-based approach, the model predictive controller usually requires the drive profile to be known a priori. However, in this study, an average concept based model predictive controller is proposed without such knowledge. Simulation results show that a prescient model predictive controller saves approximately 21% more fuel compared to the conventional bulldozer and the average concept based model predictive controller performs similarly to the prescient model predictive controller. Meanwhile, the results of the two model predictive controllers are compared with dynamic programming and rule-based energy management strategy to show the benefit of model predictive controllers. In addition, the robustness of this average concept based model predictive controller is also verified under several disturbed drive cycles. The proposed model predictive controller is independent of powertrain topology such that it can be directly extended to other types of hybrid electric tracked bulldozers, and it provides a way to apply the model predictive controller even though future driving information is unavailable.

In this paper, a model predictive controller is developed to reduce the fuel consumption of hybrid electric tracked bulldozers. As an optimization-based approach, the model predictive controller usually requires the drive profile to be known a priori. However, in this study, an average concept based model predictive controller is proposed without such knowledge. Simulation results show that a prescient model predictive controller saves approximately 21% more fuel compared to the conventional bulldozer and the average concept based model predictive controller performs similarly to the prescient model predictive controller. Meanwhile, the results of the two model predictive controllers are compared with dynamic programming and rule-based energy management strategy to show the benefit of model predictive controllers. In addition, the robustness of this average concept based model predictive controller is also verified under several disturbed drive cycles. The proposed model predictive controller is independent of powertrain topology such that it can be directly extended to other types of hybrid electric tracked bulldozers, and it provides a way to apply the model predictive controller even though future driving information is unavailable.

                  A hierarchical hybrid control system is proposed to cope with highly automated driving in highway environments with multiple lanes and surrounding vehicles. In the high-level layer, the discrete driving decisions are coordinated by the finite-state machine (FSM) based on the relative position identification and predictive longitudinal distance of the surrounding vehicles. The low-level layer is responsible for the vehicle motion control, where the model predictive control (MPC) approach is utilized to integrate the longitudinal and lateral control mainly including car-following control and lane changing control. The proposed control system focuses on two issues regarding safe driving on highways. On one hand, the subject vehicle must always keep a safe distance with its leading vehicle to avoid the rear-end collision. On the other hand, the subject vehicle should also overtake the preceding vehicle by safe lane changes if the desired speed is not achieved. The effectiveness of the hybrid control is tested in the simulation, whose results verify that the driving decisions are made reasonably and the vehicle motion control obeys stability and comfort requirements. Moreover, it is also indicated by the simulations in random scenarios that the control strategy is able to deal with most of ordinary situations on highways although some emergency situations or critical driving maneuvers of other vehicles are not considered.

                  Regenerative braking is a key technology for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) to improve fuel economy, and it is a multi-objective control problem, which should ensure vehicle braking safety, recover more energy, and protect components from aging.

However, the damage to is usually ignored in regenerative braking. Therefore, this paper proposed a hierarchical control strategy with battery aging consideration to solve the problem. In the up-level controller, the control targets are to recover more energy and minimize aging of the battery in general braking mode, and ensuring the vehicle braking safety in emergency braking mode at the same time.

To develop the target strategy, performance degradation models are built for two power sources: a proton exchange membrane fuel cell and a lithium ion battery. This study provides an online co-state updating method for uncertain driving cycles. The method allows the battery’s state of charge to be controlled within a certain range and determines the nearly optimal hydrogen consumption. Furthermore, by incorporating a fuel cell power variation limiting factor with a weight coefficient into the PMP to suppress power changes, the durability of the fuel cell can be improved. The average daily operating cost (calculated based on the fuel consumption and power source degradation) is used to evaluate the trade-off between fuel economy and power source durability. Simulation results show that the fuel cell durability is improved with a slight increase in fuel consumption and battery degradation, and that the average daily operating cost is effectively reduced. A comparison with the results obtained by adopting a rule-based EMS and a dynamic programming-based EMS indicate the superiority of the proposed EMS.

This study highlights the significance of the driving conditions and the conflict between the optimization of investment cost, efficiency and life cycle impact (LCA) in powertrain design optimization of these kinds of vehicles. A single-objective (minimization of cost, fuel or LCA CO2eq) and multi-objective genetic algorithms (minimization of the couples cost and fuel, cost and LCA CO2eq, fuel and LCA CO2eq), linked with the vehicle simulation software ADVISOR, are used to optimize the design of powertrain components. The main outcomes of the research are as follows. The optimization of LCA CO2eq emissions and cost are conflicting as well as cost and energy use, what can be observed in the Pareto solutions. The fuel and LCA CO2eq emissions optimization are coupled for pure hybrids but not for plug-in hybrid configurations, due to the electricity consumption. Fuel cell buses can reduce the energy consumption by 58%, and emit 67% less LCA CO2eq than the conventional diesel bus, and achieve compensatory payback of 0.620$/km (depending on the hydrogen price).

The system to be tested is split into a physical substructure and a real-time numerical simulation which are coupled using actuators and sensors to transfer data at the interface in real-time. In order to achieve stable and accurate hybrid testing representative of the true system, high fidelity control is required at the substructure interface.

This paper investigates the effectiveness of a combined compensation strategy based on passivity control and adaptive feedforward filtering to improve stability, robustness and tracking performance in real-time hybrid testing.

                  In this paper, a linear parameter varying (LPV) control strategy is implemented in order to reduce torque ripple in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV). The Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) ripples are attenuated by a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine (PMSM). Because the ICE motor generates persistent disturbances which vary with the rotational speed, it is necessary to design a LPV controller. The control strategy uses the internal model principle. The controller is designed by several steps which includes linear matrix inequalities optimization (LMIs). A test bed simulator is used through a complete modeling of a hybrid powertrain propulsion. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the control.

                  Lightweight design and electrified powertrain have become important strategies in the automotive industry to reduce fuel demand and break down emissions respectively. Lightweighting of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is considered a step forward because advantages of both EVs and lightweight design could be combined to reduce environmental impacts even further. This paper would contribute to the advancement of knowledge in this field and it deals with the environmental analysis, by means of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), of composite-based and hybrid material lightweight solutions for EVs modules in comparison with the corresponding reference ones, by assuming no changes in the powertrain system (e.g. battery resizing). Particular attention is given to primary data collection to build the environmental eco-profiles of four innovative composites. Then, a four-level approach to interpret LCA outcomes in a clear and comprehensive way is proposed in this paper. Despite the relevant mass reduction, environmental benefits are not registered for all the analysed solutions, and the main reason is the large impact from the production stage of the new materials, raw materials particularly. Outcomes from this paper showed that Abiotic Depletion Potential (ADPel.) generally had a different trend if compared to Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Primary Energy Demand (PED) so their evaluation in parallel is recommended. Overall, the innovative materials that have a high impact in the production stage could not be suitable in the case of EVs where the emission rate in the use stage is lower than the one of traditional vehicle, so a different application should be also evaluated.

                  For plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, deeper battery discharge provides more electrical energy at a lower cost than fossil fuel, which reduces the overall energy consumption cost. However, it also accelerates battery degradation and increases the equivalent cost of battery life loss. Therefore, the battery depth of discharge (DOD) needs to be optimized to minimize the overall cost. For connected plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, the longitudinal velocity planning determines the energy demands, which directly affects the charging or discharging current to the battery and therefore affects DOD, aging, and fuel consumption as well. For connected plug-in hybrid electric buses running on fixed routes, in order to coordinate the velocity planning and battery health protection, this paper proposes a real-time energy management strategy aimed at achieving the minimum overall cost by optimizing the DOD and velocity planning. The proposed method is evaluated in an urban traffic scenario, and the goal of achieving optimal DOD is divided into a co-optimization problem over each moving horizon, where the velocity planning and energy management are traded off by minimizing the sum of driving safety cost, energy consumption cost, and equivalent cost of battery life loss. The results show that the proposed far-sighted economy-oriented methodology is superior to a short-sighted velocity planning and energy management method, and has an obvious advantage in the total cost compared with other conventional methods using a preset DOD. Moreover, the impacts of possible communication delays and prediction horizon lengths on the optimization performance and computational cost are investigated. The proposed method provides a promising management strategy for future connected and autonomous mobility design, which can mitigate battery capacity degradation and improve the fuel economy.

                  Despite extensive work on the fuel consumption of vehicles, the evaluation of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) requires a model that can predict fuel consumption second by second. In this paper, a fuel consumption model for hybrid vehicles is developed based on the operation of internal combustion engine (ICE), electric machine (EM) and battery. The fuel consumption model for engine is based on steady-state fuel mapping with a transient correction. EM and battery module (EBM) is introduced to estimate the fuel consumption for different modes of hybrid vehicle. The Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) measurements of different driving cycles including the steady-state cycle, the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) cycle, the Highway cycle and the United States 06 (US06) cycle are used to verified the model. With cellular automaton simulation, we study the fuel consumption in traffic flow and show that the fuel consumption can be significantly reduced by hybrid mode. The mean fuel saving is approximately 30% in the traffic flow on a horizontal road. The fuel consumption of traffic flow under uphill, downhill, tailwind and headwind conditions also showes considerable fuel saving. The model can be used to evaluate the fuel economy of HEVs, and provide eco-driving route-choice suggestions for drivers.

                  Hydrogen fuel consumption, battery lifetime, and battery energy loss are important performance indicators for fuel cell hybrid vehicles (FCHVs). Prior research into FCHV power source sizing has focused on minimizing fuel consumption and lowering powertrain cost, but has largely neglected to address the challenge of improving battery performance (e.g., prolonging battery lifetime). This study develops a power source sizing model that applies Pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP) as the power management strategy to optimize battery lifetime while reducing battery energy loss, fuel consumption, and powertrain cost. Battery current and SOC constraints are applied as control objectives to both reduce battery energy loss and prolong battery lifetime. In addition, fuel consumption is included as a control objective to minimize the operating cost (i.e., hydrogen consumption) of FCHVs. The developed model is applied under the driving conditions outlined by EPA Federal Test Procedure 72 (FTP-72). The simulation results of battery current, battery energy loss, battery state of charge (SOC), battery lifetime, as well as fuel consumption are compared under conditions with and without the battery current constraint. Simulation results with the battery current constraint applied show the range of SOC and the battery energy loss to be 0.23% and 5.6% lower, respectively, than those without the current constraint. Additionally, battery lifetime and fuel consumption are seen to be 0.417% and 0.068% higher, respectively, when the current constraint is applied.

                  Online optimal energy management of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles has been continually investigated for better fuel economy. This paper proposed a predictive energy management strategy based on multi neural networks for a multi-mode plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. To attain it, firstly, the offline optimal results prepared for knowledge learning are derived by dynamic programming and Pontryagin’s minimum principle. Then, the mode recognition neural network is trained based on the optimal results of dynamic programming and the recurrent neural network is firstly exploited to realize online co-state estimation application. Consequently, the velocity prediction-based online model predictive control framework is established with the co-state correction and slacked constraints to solve the real-time optimal control sequence. A series of numerical simulation results validate that the optimal performance yielded from global optimal strategy can be exploited online to attain the satisfied cost reduction, compared with equivalent consumption minimum strategy, with the assistance of estimated real time co-state and slacked reference. In addition, the computation duration of proposed algorithm decreases by 23.40%, compared with conventional Pontryagin’s minimum principle-based model predictive control scheme, thereby proving its online application potential.

To attain it, firstly, the offline optimal results prepared for knowledge learning are derived by dynamic programming and Pontryagin’s minimum principle. Then, the mode recognition neural network is trained based on the optimal results of dynamic programming and the recurrent neural network is firstly exploited to realize online co-state estimation application. Consequently, the velocity prediction-based online model predictive control framework is established with the co-state correction and slacked constraints to solve the real-time optimal control sequence. A series of numerical simulation results validate that the optimal performance yielded from global optimal strategy can be exploited online to attain the satisfied cost reduction, compared with equivalent consumption minimum strategy, with the assistance of estimated real time co-state and slacked reference. In addition, the computation duration of proposed algorithm decreases by 23.40%, compared with conventional Pontryagin’s minimum principle-based model predictive control scheme, thereby proving its online application potential.

                  In this paper, an adaptive energy management system consisting of off-line and online parts is presented to improve the energy efficiency of a parallel hybrid electric bus. The off-line part discusses how to precisely recognize the driver's driving style based on the hybrid algorithm. Specially, K nearest neighbor method is applied to reduce the number of samples as the preprocessor, and the expectation maximization method is leveraged to speculate the class using similar training samples. Furthermore, the driving style recognition module is built and employed to classify the driver's driving style from aggressive to conservative at each time step. On the other hand, the online part performs the involved energy management strategy, which incorporates driver's driving style into the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS). Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of charging sustainability and equivalent fuel consumption in the proposed strategy exceed those in the ECMS, as for both aggressive and conservative drivers. Comparative results obtained from HIL tests also indicate that the fuel economy of the proposed strategy is improved by 9.54% and 7.03% for aggressive and conservative drivers compared with ECMS, respectively.

                  Hybrid electric buses have been a promising technology to dramatically lower fuel consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, while energy management strategy (EMS) is a critical technology to the improvements in fuel economy for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). In this paper, a suboptimal EMS is developed for the real-time control of a series–parallel hybrid electric bus. It is then investigated and verified in a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation system constructed on PT-LABCAR, a commercial real-time simulator. First, an optimal EMS is obtained via iterative dynamic programming (IDP) by defining a cost function over a specific drive cycle to minimize fuel consumption, as well as to achieve zero battery state-of-charge (SOC) change and to avoid frequent clutch operation. The IDP method can lower the computational burden and improve the accuracy. Second, the suboptimal EMS for real-time control is developed by constructing an Elman neural network (NN) based on the aforementioned optimal EMS, so the real-time suboptimal EMS can be used in the vehicle control unit (VCU) of the hybrid bus. The real VCU is investigated and verified utilizing a HIL simulator in a virtual forward-facing HEV environment consisting of vehicle, driver and driving environment. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed real-time suboptimal EMS by the neural network can coordinate the overall hybrid powertrain of the hybrid bus to optimize fuel economy over different drive cycles, and the given drive cycles can be tracked while sustaining the battery SOC level.

                  Plug-in hybrid electric buses with large battery packs exhibit salient advantages in increasing fuel economy and reducing toxic emissions. However, they may be subject to expensive battery replacement caused by battery aging. This paper designs an online, coordinated optimization approach, based on Pontryagin’s minimum principle, for a single-shaft parallel plug-in hybrid electric bus, aiming at minimizing the total cost of energy consumption and battery degradation. Specifically, three key contributions are delivered to complement the relevant literature. First, a capacity loss model for lithium ion batteries emulating dynamics of both cycle life and calendar life is exploited in the optimization framework, in order to highlight the importance of considering calendar life and its implication to overall energy management performance in real bus operations. Second, the online adaptive mechanism of the optimization method with respect to varying driving conditions is achieved by tracking two reference trajectories to adjust the state of charge and effective ampere-hour throughput of the battery. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, various comparative studies are carried out, accounting for different driving scenarios. Simulation results show that the maximum control errors between the proposed strategy and Pontryagin’s minimum principle are only 0.4% in the battery capacity loss and 2.7% in fuel economy under four random driving cycles, which indicates the prominent adaptability and optimization performance of the designed strategy.

                  Hybrid electric vehicles offer an immediate solution for emissions reduction and fuel displacement under the current technique level. Energy management strategies are critical for improving fuel economy of hybrid electric vehicles. In this paper we propose a energy management strategy for a series-parallel plug-in hybrid electric bus based on deep deterministic policy gradients. Specifically, deep deterministic policy gradients is an actor-critic, model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that can assign the optimal energy split of the bus over continuous spaces. We consider that the buses are driving in a fixed bus line, where driving cycle is constrained by the traffic. The traffic information and number of passengers are also incorporated into the energy management system. The deep reinforcement learning based energy management agent is trained with a large amount of driving cycles that generated from traffic simulation. Experiments on the traffic simulation driving cycles show that the proposed approach outperforms conventional reinforcement learning approach and exhibits performance close to the global optimal dynamic programming. Moreover, it also has great generality to the standard driving cycles that are significantly different with the ones that it has been trained with. We also show some interesting attributes of learned energy management strategies through visualizations of the actor and critic. The main contribution of this study is to explore the incorporation of traffic information within hybrid electric vehicle energy managment through advanced intelligent algorithms.

This paper presents an energy based method to quickly screen different types of HEVs for many and long driving cycles, in order to find interesting candidates for deeper and more accurate analysis. The technique used also allows to derive the fuel consumption analytically, and thus it is a very effective tool to explain the main fuel savings mechanisms of different types of HEVs and how they are influenced by the driving cycle. Some of the simplifications will lead to errors, but since the sign of the main errors are known it is still easy to draw several clear conclusions using the method.

                  This paper presents a hypothetical conversion of a conventional heavy haul diesel-electric locomotive to its hybrid counterpart by incorporating a battery energy storage system. Starting from the basic parameters of a 1.6 MW diesel-electric locomotive currently found in the national railway company locomotive fleet, the quasi-static model of the locomotive is derived and validated. The conventional locomotive model is then converted to its hybrid counterpart by adding a battery energy storage system in parallel to the generator and equipping it with an adequate optimized energy management control strategy. The hybrid locomotive powertrain components are also appropriately re-sized in order to meet comparable traction force and power performance. Both the conventional and hybridized locomotive models are then used for the purpose of comparative analysis of main vehicle characteristics for the mountainous railway route driving scenario, which includes realistic slope and speed limitations. The obtained simulation results are used to gain insights about the possible advantages of the proposed conversion/drivetrain hybridization in terms of feasible reduction of fuel consumption and related CO2 emissions, while also considering additional hybridization costs and return-of-investment period.

A state machine strategy based on droop control is proposed to coordinate multiple power sources, avoid the transients and rapid changes of power demand, and achieve high efficiency without degrading the mechanism performance for an energy management system of hybrid tramway. A hybrid system model of tramway is established with commercially available devices, and then the proposed energy management strategy is evaluated with a real driving cycle of tramway from Turkey. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy is able to coordinate multiple power sources based on their natural characteristics, satisfy rapid changes of the power demand and achieve high efficiency of overall tramway. Hence, the proposed energy management strategy for high-power hybrid tramway will improve the hydrogen consumptions of overall hybrid system and the efficiencies of each power source.

The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy is able to coordinate multiple power sources based on their natural characteristics, satisfy rapid changes of the power demand and achieve high efficiency of overall tramway. Hence, the proposed energy management strategy for high-power hybrid tramway will improve the hydrogen consumptions of overall hybrid system and the efficiencies of each power source.

                  A new road vehicle powertrain simulator is presented and applied to vehicle dynamics. The electric motor, the fuel cell, the energy storage system (ESS), the braking rules, and the energy management strategy (EMS) heuristic rules are modelled. The role of the EMS and the ESS in the fuel consumption of a fuel cell hybrid vehicle is analysed, and the influence of the duty cycle on the results is examined. Simplified EMS if-then heuristic rules are used to describe powertrain behaviour. The developed simulator is used in an actual application, a fuel cell hybrid taxi, performing over a standard driving cycle, the NEDC, and over a specific duty cycle, the London DC, both with zero grade but with different dynamics. The results indicate that the EMS can have a significant impact on hydrogen consumption, leading to 7–10% less energy consumption because of the EMS improvements. Additionally, the EMS has less impact on the duty cycle when the vehicle is subjected to a more dynamic profile. The design of the EMS will depend on the particular ESS. The achieved 5% impact in the same duty cycle, especially with the hybrid ESS, clearly indicates the importance of optimizing the EMS according to the ESS components and vehicle usage.

                  The present paper is focused on the design, optimization and analysis of a complex parallel hybrid electric vehicle, equipped with two electric machines on both the front and rear axles, and on the evaluation of its potential to reduce fuel consumption and NOx emissions over several driving missions. The vehicle has been compared with two conventional parallel hybrid vehicles, equipped with a single electric machine on the front axle or on the rear axle, as well as with a conventional vehicle. All the vehicles have been equipped with compression ignition engines.
                  The optimal layout of each vehicle was identified on the basis of the minimization of the overall powertrain costs during the whole vehicle life. These costs include the initial investment due to the production of the components as well as the operating costs related to fuel consumption and to battery depletion.
                  Identification of the optimal powertrain control strategy, in terms of the management of the power flows of the engine and electric machines, and of gear selection, is necessary in order to be able to fully exploit the potential of the hybrid architecture.
                  To this end, two global optimizers, one of a deterministic nature and another of a stochastic type, and two real-time optimizers have been developed, applied and compared.
                  A new mathematical technique has been developed and applied to the vehicle simulation model in order to decrease the computational time of the optimizers. First, the vehicle model equations were written in order to allow a coarse time grid to be used, then, the control variables (i.e., power flow and gear number) were discretized, and the values of the main model variables were evaluated and stored in a matrix (referred to as configuration matrix), for all the possible combinations of control variables and for each time node, before the optimization process. In this way, the optimizers can read the actual values of the relevant variables from the pre-processed data, instead of calculating them iteratively during the optimization stage. The performance of the hybrid vehicles has been evaluated over several driving missions, including the NEDC, the FTP, the AUDC, the ARDR and the AMDC, and a detailed energetic analysis has been carried out in order to clearly identify the key operating modes that contribute most to the fuel consumption and NOx emission savings of the different hybrid architectures.

                  The aim of this paper is to propose a battery aging conscious energy management strategy. The initial design of an energy management strategy is a significant point, in order to fulfill the efficiency goals in a short term. However, with the aging, the initial conditions vary. The new trend of digitalization allows to monitor the operation, having the possibility to update the developed first strategy in a long term. Therefore a methodology for updating the energy management strategy throughout the bus lifetime is proposed, in order to improve the operation costs and extend the battery lifetime. This update is based on a dynamic programming optimization, tuning the fuzzy logic membership functions and output. Operation costs improvements up to 32.5% are obtained beside a rule-based strategy and a BT lifetime extension of 5.64% is reached. A sensitivity analysis for identifying the critical factors affecting the plug-in hybrid electric bus energy management strategy has been carried out. Auxiliary consumption variation and battery lifetime throughout the bus lifetime have been identified as the most affecting factors.

                  Waste heat recovery (WHR) systems suggest a promising solution for reducing vehicle CO2 emissions in order to meet the CAFE targets by 2025. This paper presents a methodology to improve the overall efficiency of a combined cycle machine consisting of a reciprocating internal combustion engine (ICE) coupled to a thermoacoustic (TAE) machine used for thermal-to-electric WHR. It investigates the potential of calibrating the ICE at some specific points of its engine map in order to achieve an optimal overall efficiency when coupled to the bottoming thermoacoustic cycle. A three-cylinder gasoline engine is modeled using GT suite code and the effect of spark timing delay on exhaust temperature, exhaust flow and engine brake efficiency are compared to real engine test bench values. Three bottoming thermoacoustic configurations coupled to this ICE are modeled and calibrated according to test results performed on a thermoacoustic machine prototype.

                  In this study, dynamic particle swarm optimization was used to develop optimal strategies for two-variable energy management and gear-shifting in hybrid electric vehicles. To perform simulations, six mathematical subsystems, including a spark ignition engine, lithium battery module, traction motor, automatic manual transmission, longitudinal vehicle dynamics, and driver model were constructed. The control strategies for energy management and gear-shifting were modeled using a dynamic particle swarm optimization strategy with three inputs (i.e., battery state-of-charge, engine speed, and demanded torque) and two outputs (i.e., power-split ratio and gear number). The optimization process was divided into six sequential steps. Four different cases were selected for comparison. The results demonstrate that compared with the baseline case, the improvements in the equivalent fuel and energy consumed in the two-variable optimization case were 30.75% and 59.55%, respectively, during the standard European city driving cycle, and 20.54% and 46.95%, respectively, during the federal test procedure cycle. Consequently, the proposed optimization strategy brought superior performance when applied to hybrid energy management and transmission control. The results of a hardware-in-the-loop verification also confirm the effective performance of proposed the online control. In future work, tests using a real vehicle will be conducted.

                  Efficient energy management in hybrid vehicles is the key for reducing fuel consumption and emissions. To capitalize on the benefits of using PHEVs (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles), an intelligent energy management system is developed and evaluated in this paper. Models of vehicle engine, air conditioning, powertrain, and hybrid electric drive system are first developed. The effect of road parameters such as bend direction and road slope angle as well as environmental factors such as wind (direction and speed) and thermal conditions are also modeled. Due to the nonlinear and complex nature of the interactions between PHEV–Environment–Driver components, a soft computing based intelligent management system is developed using three fuzzy logic controllers. The crucial fuzzy engine controller within the intelligent energy management system is made adaptive by using a hybrid multi-layer adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system with genetic algorithm optimization. For adaptive learning, a number of datasets were created for different road conditions and a hybrid learning algorithm based on the least squared error estimate using the gradient descent method was proposed. The proposed adaptive intelligent energy management system can learn while it is running and makes proper adjustments during its operation. It is shown that the proposed intelligent energy management system is improving the performance of other existing systems.

This paper proposes an online updating energy management strategy to improve the fuel economy of hybrid electric tracked vehicles. As the basis of the research, the overall model for the hybrid electric tracked vehicle is built in detail and validated through the field experiment. To accelerate the convergence rate of the control policy calculation, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm called fast Q-learning is applied which improves the computational speed by 16%. The cloud-computation is presented to afford the main computation burden to realize the online updating energy management strategy in hardware-in-loop simulation bench. The Kullback-Leibler divergence rate to trigger the update of the control strategy is designed and realized in hardware-in-loop simulation bench. The simulation results show that the fuel consumption of the fast Q-learning based online updating strategy is 4.6% lower than that of stationary strategy, and is close to that of dynamic programming strategy. Besides, the computation time of the proposed method is only 1.35 s which is much shorter than that of dynamic programming based method. The results indicate that the proposed energy management strategy can greatly improve the fuel economy and have the potential to be applied in the real-time application. Moreover, the adaptability of the online energy management strategy is validated in three realistic driving schedules.

                  New powertrain technologies, such as Hybrid Electric Vehicles, have a price premium which can often be offset by lower running costs. Total Cost of Ownership combines these purchase and operating expenses to identify the most economical choice of vehicle. This is a valuable assessment for private and fleet purchasers alike. Studies to date have not compared Total Cost of Ownership across more than two vehicle markets or analysed historic costs. To address this gap, this research provides a more extensive Total Cost of Ownership assessment of conventional, Hybrid, Plug-in Hybrid and Battery Electric Vehicles in three industrialized countries – the UK, USA (using California and Texas as case studies) and Japan – for the time period 1997–2015. Finally, the link between Hybrid Electric Vehicle Total Cost of Ownership and market share is analysed with a panel regression model.
                  In all regions the incremental Total Cost of Ownership of hybrid and electric vehicles compared to conventional vehicles has reduced from the year of introduction and 2015. Year on year Hybrid Electric Vehicles Total Cost of Ownership was found to vary least in the UK due to the absence of subsidies. Market share was found to be strongly linked to Hybrid Electric Vehicle Total Cost of Ownership through a panel regression analysis. Financial subsidies have enabled Battery Electric Vehicles to reach cost parity in the UK, California and Texas, but this is not the case for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles which haven’t received as much financial backing. This research has implications for fleet purchasers and private owners who are considering switching to a low-emission vehicle. The findings are also of interest to policymakers that are keen to develop effective measures to stimulate decarbonisation of the fleet and improve air quality.

                  In the last decades, due to emissions reduction policies, research focused on alternative powertrains among which hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) powered by fuel cells are becoming an attractive solution. One of the main issues of these vehicles is the energy management in order to improve the overall fuel economy. The present investigation aims at identifying the best hybrid vehicle configuration and control strategy to reduce fuel consumption. The study focuses on a car powered by a fuel cell and equipped with two secondary energy storage devices: batteries and super-capacitors. To model the powertrain behavior an on purpose simulation program called ECoS has been developed in Matlab/Simulink environment. The fuel cell model is based on the Amphlett theory. The battery and the super-capacitor models account for charge/discharge efficiency. The analyzed powertrain is also equipped with an energy regeneration system to recover braking energy. The numerical optimization of vehicle configuration and control strategy of the hybrid electric vehicle has been carried out with a multi objective genetic algorithm. The goal of the optimization is the reduction of hydrogen consumption while sustaining the battery state of charge. By applying the algorithm to different driving cycles, several optimized configurations have been identified and discussed.

                  Traditional optimization-based energy management strategies (EMSs) do not consider the uncertainty of driving cycle induced by the change of traffic conditions, this paper proposes a robust online EMS (ROEMS) for fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FCHEV) to handle the uncertain driving cycles. The energy consumption model of the FCHEV is built by considering the power loss of fuel cell, battery, electric motor, and brake. An offline linear programming-based method is proposed to produce the benchmark solution. The ROEMS instantaneously minimizes the equivalent power of fuel cell and battery, where an equivalent efficiency of battery is defined as the efficiency of hydrogen energy transforming to battery energy. To control the state of charge of battery, two control coefficients are introduced to adjust the power of battery in objective function. Another penalty coefficient is used to amend the power of fuel cell, which reduces the load change of fuel cell so as to slow the degradation of fuel cell. The simulation results indicate that ROEMS has good performance in both fuel economy and load change control of fuel cell. The most important advantage of ROEMS is its robustness and adaptivity, because it almost produces the optimal solution without changing the control parameters when driving cycles are changed.

                  Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) have a large battery pack, and the depth of discharge (DOD) significantly affects the battery longevity. In this paper, the battery degradation is considered in the co-optimization of battery size and energy management for PHEVs using convex programming. The impact of DOD on battery degradation and energy management is also investigated. The cost function consists of fuel consumption, electrical energy consumption, and equivalent battery life loss. A real-world speed profile collected from the urban city bus route up to about 70 km is used as an input to evaluate the proposed method. The results suggest that, for both cases with and without battery degradation, the total cost curve with respect to the preset final state of charge (SOC) is an upward parabola, where the optimal DOD can be identified, and the optimal battery size and energy management can be determined. The results also show that, with an initial SOC of 0.9, the proposed method can reduce the total cost by 3.6 CNY compared to other existing studies with the fixed final SOC. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to explore the effect of battery price and initial SOC on the optimal DOD and total cost.

                  The majority of transportation-related CO2 growth will come from the developing world with projections suggesting that global CO2 emissions from transportation will at least double by 2050. Given that China will be a leading contributor to this growth in transportation-related CO2, this paper examines the impact of deploying different types of hybrid cars in China to offset some of the growth in CO2 emissions arising from rapidly growing vehicle sales.
                  To represent typical Chinese driving conditions, drive cycles are selected from 11 Chinese cities of different size, with the drive cycles capturing on peak and off peak driving times, and road types including freeways, major arterials, sub-arterials, and residential roads. The characteristics of the different drive cycles are compared against US drive cycles and it is found that Chinese driving often involves lower speed driving, a moderate stop frequency and more sudden acceleration and deceleration. The drive cycles are then used as inputs for powertrain models for a conventional engine-only vehicle, a mild parallel hybrid with integrated starter/generator, a power–split hybrid, and a conventional gasoline vehicle with start–stop functionality. The fuel savings potential from each vehicle architecture is compared against the conventional vehicle in US and Chinese driving conditions.
                  The results show that the driving conditions in China enable hybrid vehicles to achieve significantly greater fuel savings as compared with hybrids in the US, with parallel hybrids producing 25.5% fuel savings in China versus 13.2% fuel savings in the US and power–split hybrids producing 53.6% fuel savings in China versus 32.6% fuel savings in the US. The fuel savings benefits from parallel and power–split hybrids significantly exceed the fuel savings from conventional gasoline vehicles with start–stop functionality for both the US and China. These results suggest that the increased cost of deploying hybrids will have significantly greater impact in Chinese driving conditions, and hybrid vehicles in China should be seriously considered for incentive programs (perhaps as part of the recently announced 2012–2020 China automotive industry development plan) to accelerate their deployment.

                  When designing hybrid vehicles, the energy management is formulated as an optimal control problem. The Pontryagin’s minimum principle represents a powerful methodology capable of solving the energy management offline. Moreover, the Pontryagin’s minimum principle has been proved useful in the derivation of online energy management algorithms, such as the equivalent consumption minimization strategy. Nevertheless, difficulties on the application of the Pontryagin’s minimum principle arise when state constraints are included in the definition of the problem. A possible solution is to combine the Pontryagin’s minimum principle with a penalty function approach. This is done by adding functions to the Hamiltonian, which increase the value of the Hamiltonian whenever the optimal trajectory violates its constraints. However, the addition of penalty functions to the Hamiltonian makes it harder to compute its minimum. This work proposes an effective penalty approach through an implicit Hamiltonian minimization. The proposed method is applied to solve the energy management for a hybrid electric vehicle modeled as a mixed input-state constrained optimal control problem with two states: the battery temperature and state-of-energy. It is demonstrated to be up to 46 times faster than the dynamic programming method while taking benefits of state-of-the-art boundary value problem solvers and avoiding any issue related to state quantization.

                  Energy management strategy plays a key role for Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicles (FCHEVs), it directly affects the efficiency and performance of energy storages in FCHEVs. For example, by using a suitable energy distribution controller, the fuel cell system can be maintained in a high efficiency region and thus saving hydrogen consumption. In this paper, an energy management strategy for online driving cycles is proposed based on a combination of the parameters from three offline optimized fuzzy logic controllers using data fusion approach. The fuzzy logic controllers are respectively optimized for three typical driving scenarios: highway, suburban and city in offline. To classify patterns of online driving cycles, a Probabilistic Support Vector Machine (PSVM) is used to provide probabilistic classification results. Based on the classification results of the online driving cycle, the parameters of each offline optimized fuzzy logic controllers are then fused using Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory, in order to calculate the final parameters for the online fuzzy logic controller. Three experimental validations using Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) platform with different-sized FCHEVs have been performed. Experimental comparison results show that, the proposed PSVM-DS based online controller can achieve a relatively stable operation and a higher efficiency of fuel cell system in real driving cycles.

                  Due to slow internal mass transport, the fuel cell is a typical time-delay control object in vehicular hybrid powertrain. To yield better control effect, the predictive control is considered as an effective solution, in which the short-term power demand of vehicle is a key input variable and must be predicted accurately. However, a time-phase mismatch phenomenon usually occurs in prediction results when using non-iterative direct prediction method, resulting in poor prediction accuracy. This study systematically explains the mechanism of the studied time-phase mismatch and proposes a novel iterative learning framework (ILF) to reduce it. Several machine learning algorithms are compared to select a proper learning core for ILF. The results show that prediction RMSE reduces up to 76.8% and 65.0% for the power and power change rate predictions, respectively, comparing with non-iterative prediction manner. The least-squares support vector machine as the learning core of ILF achieves the best performance within the shortest runtime. Moreover, the proposed ILF predictor has a good adaptability to various driving conditions through more validations. The proposed ILF has better predictable ability for the future data comparing with classical recurrent time-series prediction method. The proposed ILF is expected to improve the accuracy of vehicle load-status perception.

                  To improve computational efficiency of energy management strategies for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), this paper proposes a stochastic model predictive controller (MPC) based on Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle (PMP), which differs from widely used dynamic programming (DP)-based predictive methods. First, short-time speed forecasting is achieved using a Markov chain model, based on real-world driving cycles. The PMP- and DP-based MPCs are compared under four preview horizons (5 s, 10 s, 15 s and 20 s), and the results show that the computational time of the DP-MPC is almost four times of that in the PMP-MPC. Moreover, the influence of predication horizon length on computational time and energy consumption is examined. Given a preview horizon of 5 s, the PMP-MPC holds a total energy consumption cost of 7.80 USD and computational time per second of 0.0130 s. When the preview horizon increases to 20 s, the total cost is 7.77 USD with the computational time per second increasing to 0.0502 s. Finally, DP, PMP, and rule-based strategies are contrasted to the PMP-MPC method, further demonstrating the promising performance and computational efficiency of the proposed methodology.

                  Because hydrogen can be extracted naturally and stored for a long time, different types of fuel cells have been developed to generate clean power, particularly for use in vehicles. However, the power demand of a running vehicle leads to unstable and irregular loading of fuel cells. This not only reduces fuel cell lifespan and efficiency but also affects driving safety when the slow output response cannot satisfy an abrupt increase in power demand. Magnetic flywheels with characteristics such as high energy density, high-speed charging ability, and low loss have been extensively used in Formula One cars. This study developed a hybrid powertrain in which a magnetic flywheel system (MFS) is integrated with the fuel cells to solve the aforementioned problems. Moreover, an auto-tuning proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller based on the controls of a multiple adaptive neuro-fuzzy interference system and particle swarm optimization was designed for MFS control. Furthermore, MATLAB/Simulink simulations considering an FTP-75 urban driving cycle were conducted, and a variability improvement of approximately 27.3% in fuel cell output was achieved.

                  Fuel Cell Hybrid Vehicles (FCHV) can reach near zero emission by removing the conventional internal combustion from the vehicle powertrain. Nevertheless, before seeing competitive and efficient FCHV on the market, at market prices, different technical, economic, and social challenges should be overcome. A typical hybrid fuel cell powertrain combines a fuel cell stack and a dedicated energy storage system along with their necessary power converters. Energy storage systems are used in order to enhance the well-to-wheel efficiency and thus reducing the hydrogen consumption. An efficient management of power flows on the vehicle, allows optimizing the recovery of energy braking. Moreover, working in the fuel cell maximum efficiency leads to reduced thermal losses and thus to the downsizing of the heat exchangers. This paper presents an enhanced control of the power flows on a FCHV in order to reduce the hydrogen consumption, by generating and storing the electrical energy only at the most suitable moments on a given driving cycle. While the off-line optimization-based on dynamic programming algorithm offers the necessary optimal comparison reference on a known demand, the proposed strategy which can be implemented on-line, is based on a fuzzy logic decision system. The fine tuning of the fuzzy system parameters (mainly the membership functions and the gains), is made using a genetic algorithm and the fuzzy supervisor shows performing results for different load profiles.

But dealing with the complicated traffic conditions and finding an approximated global optimal strategy which is applicable to the plug-in hybrid electric bus still remains a challenging technique. To solve this problem, a novel driving-behavior-aware modified stochastic model predictive control method is proposed for the plug-in hybrid electric bus. Firstly, the K-means is employed to classify driving behaviors, and the driver models based on Markov chains is obtained under different kinds of driving behaviors. While the obtained driver behaviors are regarded as stochastic disturbance inputs, the local minimum fuel consumption might be obtained with a traditional stochastic model predictive control at each step, taking tracking the reference battery state of charge trajectory into consideration in the finite predictive horizons. However, this technique is still accompanied by some working points with reduced/worsened fuel economy. Thus, the stochastic model predictive control is modified with the equivalent consumption minimization strategy to eliminate these undesirable working points. The results in real-world city bus routines show that the proposed energy management strategy could greatly improve the fuel economy of a plug-in hybrid electric bus in whole driving cycles, compared with the popular charge depleting–charge sustaining strategy and it may offer some useful insights for realizing the approximate global optimal energy management for the plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.

                  Due to the fact that demand for battery power increasing dramatically with the fast development of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), and poor power density prevents batteries absorbing more braking energy, leads to the so-called range phobia and presents a significant barrier to BEV commercialization. As one of the promising solutions, a supercapacitor-based hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is fast becoming the automotive industry trend, and there are widespread attempts of integrating multi-speed transmission in BEVs to improve electric machine efficiency. As part of the response to the above barriers, an electrified continuously variable transmission (CVT) is proposed along with HESS for BEV in this study. The improvements of passenger BEV in terms of vehicle dynamic performance, energy saving, and battery life extending through applying electrified CVT and HESS will be investigated. The impact of CVT on battery health improvement via HESS will also be analyzed. Specifically, a designed gear ratio varying control strategy is developed for electrified CVT to improve energy efficiency and vehicle performance.

These strategies are utilized to manage the energy demand response of hybrid systems, in an optimal way, under highly fluctuating load condition. Two novel strategies based on salp swarm algorithm (SSA) and mine-blast optimization are proposed. The outcomes of these strategies are compared with commonly used strategies like fuzzy logic control, classical proportional integral control, the state machine, equivalent fuel consumption minimization, maximization, external energy maximization, and equivalent consumption minimization. Hydrogen fuel economy and overall efficiency are used for the comparison of these different strategies. Results demonstrate that the proposed SSA management strategy performed best compared with all other used strategies in terms of hydrogen fuel economy and overall efficiency. The minimum consumed hydrogen and maximum efficiency are found 19.4 gm and 85.61%, respectively.

                  In this article, a multi-objective optimization-oriented energy management strategy is investigated for fuel cell hybrid vehicles on the basis of rule learning. The degradation of fuel cells and lithium-ion batteries are considered as the objective function and translated into the equivalent hydrogen consumption. The optimal fuel cell power sequence and state of charge trajectory, considered as the energy management input, are solved offline via the Pontryagin’s minimum principle. The K-means algorithm is employed to hierarchically cluster the optimal data set for preparation of rules extraction, and then the rules are excavated by the improved repeated incremental pruning to production error reduction algorithm and fitted by the quasi-Newton method. The simulation results highlight that the proposed rule learning-based energy management strategy can effectively save hydrogen consumption and prolong fuel cell life with real-time application potential.

Motivated by this, an adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy considering traffic information is proposed in this study to facilitate the effective energy management of PHEVs. First, the initial equivalent factors in terms of different initial state of charge (SOC) and driving distance are searched by genetic algorithm. Then, the simplified dynamic programming is leveraged to determine the optimal SOC trajectory according to the traffic information with fast calculation speed. The fuzzy controller is employed to regulate the equivalent factor dynamically, thus enabling effective tracking of the reference SOC trajectory. A hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform based on the virtual scene is developed to validate the performance of controller.

This paper presents an approach for the design and analysis of an FCHCV with supercapacitors as the energy-storage device. The design stage includes determination of the topology of the electrical system, energy flow analysis, and a determination of the energy-storage system. Due to the markedly changing loads, supercapacitors with high specific power and high durability seem the best choice. A control strategy based on Pontryagin's minimum principle is proposed considering hydrogen consumption, the state of charge of the supercapacitors, and fuel cell durability in the cost functions. With the selected design and proposed strategy, we propose a power source sizing methodology, and its economic influence is evaluated for both present and future FCHCVs. This study was performed with a system-level model of an FCHCV in MATLAB environment. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed strategy. Optimal power source sizes can be chosen by specific criteria of hydrogen consumption and powertrain cost.

                  In reliability assessment, a difficulty is to handle a complex system with hybrid uncertainty (aleatory and epistemic uncertainty) and dependency problem. Probability-box is a general model to represent hybrid uncertainty. Arithmetic rules on the structure are mostly used between independent random variables. However, in practice, dependency problems are also common in reliability assessment. In addition, in most real applications, there is some prior information on the dependency of components, but the available information may be not enough to determine dependent parameters. The issue is named non-deterministic dependency problem in the paper. Affine arithmetic is hence used to produce dependent interval estimates. The arithmetic sometimes has a better effect than probability-box arithmetic (interval arithmetic) in dealing with dependency problem. Bayesian network is a commonly used model in reliability assessment. Under Bayesian network framework, this paper proposes a dependency bounds analysis method that combines affine arithmetic and probability-box method to handle hybrid uncertainty and non-deterministic dependency. For the sake of illustration, this method is applied to two real systems. To show the advantages of the proposed method, the proposed method is compared with the Frechet inequalities and 2-stage Monte Carlo method in the second case study.

                  Plug-in hybrid electric buses (PHEBs) have the potential to satisfy both the fuel efficiency and the driving-mileage under complex urban traffic conditions. However, the optimal charge and discharge management is still a pivotal challenge of energy management for the inherent uncertainty in driving conditions. The common reference state-of-charge (SOC) profile based methods are limited by the adaptiveness which restricts the economic performance of on-line energy management systems. Promisingly, reinforcement learning based energy management strategies exhibited the significant self-learning ability. However, for PHEBs, the sparse rewards by the long-term SOC shortage make the strategies easily trick into the local optimal solution. The work presented in this paper concentrates on combining battery power reduction in the form of conditional entropy into reinforcement learning based energy management strategy. The proposed method named adaptive policy optimization (APO) introduces a novel advantage function to evaluate energy-saving performance considering long-term SOC dynamic, and a Bayesian neural network based SOC shortage probability estimator is utilized to optimize the energy management strategy parameterized by a deep neural network. Several experiments in a standard driving cycle demonstrate the optimality, self-learning ability and convergence of the APO. Moreover, the adaptability and robust performance get validated over the real bus trajectories data. With the comprehensive experiments in this paper, the proposed model exhibits enhanced fuel economy and more suitable SOC planning in comparison with the existing energy management strategies.

               ","ve the potential to satisfy both the fuel efficiency and the driving-mileage under complex urban traffic conditions. However, the optimal charge and discharge management is still a pivotal challenge of energy management for the inherent uncertainty in driving conditions. The common reference state-of-charge (SOC) profile based methods are limited by the adaptiveness which restricts the economic performance of on-line energy management systems. Promisingly, reinforcement learning based energy management strategies exhibited the significant self-learning ability. However, for PHEBs, the sparse rewards by the long-term SOC shortage make the strategies easily trick into the local optimal solution. The work presented in this paper concentrates on combining battery power reduction in the form of conditional entropy into reinforcement learning based energy management strategy. The proposed method named adaptive policy optimization (APO) introduces a novel advantage function to evaluate energy-saving performance considering long-term SOC dynamic, and a Bayesian neural network based SOC shortage probability estimator is utilized to optimize the energy management strategy parameterized by a deep neural network. Several experiments in a standard driving cycle demonstrate the optimality, self-learning ability and convergence of the APO. Moreover, the adaptability and robust performance get validated over the real bus trajectories data. With the comprehensive experiments in this paper, the proposed model exhibits enhanced fuel economy and more suitable SOC planning in comparison with the existing energy management strategies. The results indicate that APO respectively outperforms the compared online strategies by

                  Fuel cells aboard hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are often hybridized with an energy storage system (ESS). Batteries and ultracapacitors are the most common technologies used in ESSs aboard HEVs. High-speed flywheels are an emerging technology with traits that have the potential to make them competitive with more established battery and ultracapacitor technologies in certain vehicular applications. This study compares high-speed flywheels, ultracapacitors, and batteries functioning as the ESS in a fuel cell based HEV on the bases of cost and fuel economy. In this study, computer models were built to simulate the powertrain of a fuel cell based HEV where high-speed flywheels, batteries, and ultracapacitors of a range of sizes were used as the ESS. A simulated vehicle with a powertrain using each of these technologies was run over two different drive cycles in order to see how the different ESSs performed under different driving patterns. The results showed that when cost and fuel economy were both considered, high-speed flywheels were competitive with batteries and ultracapacitors.

                  Powertrain hybridization as well as electrical energy management are imposing new requirements on electrical storage systems in vehicles. This paper characterizes the associated vehicle attributes and, in particular, the various levels of hybrids. New requirements for the electrical storage system are derived, including: shallow-cycle life, high dynamic charge acceptance particularly for regenerative braking and robust service life in sustained partial-state-of-charge usage. Lead/acid, either with liquid or absorptive glass-fibre mat electrolyte, is expected to remain the predominant battery technology for 14V systems, including micro-hybrids, and with a cost-effective battery monitoring system for demanding applications. Advanced AGM batteries may be considered for mild or even medium hybrids once they have proven robustness under real-world conditions, particularly with respect to cycle life at partial-states-of-charge and dynamic charge acceptance. For the foreseeable future, NiMH and Li-ion are the dominating current and potential battery technologies for higher-functionality HEVs. Li-ion, currently at development and demonstration stages, offers attractive opportunities for improvements in performance and cost. Supercapacitors may be considered for pulse power applications. Aside from cell technologies, attention to the issue of system integration of the battery into the powertrain and vehicle is growing.

                  This paper proposes a new hybrid degradation model of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) used in Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) operating under real conditions. This hybrid method is based on the wavelet analysis, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). This new degradation model considers the influence of PEMFC load current, relative humidity, temperature, and hydrogen pressure. First, the wavelet analysis is used to decompose the voltage aging waveform of PEMFC into multiple sub-waveforms. Second, the ELM is applied to build the degradation model of each sub-waveform. Then, the overall degradation model of PEMFC is obtained by combining the degradation model of each sub-waveform. Finally, GA is adopted to improve the global optimization of the proposed degradation model. This model is experimentally validated by using actual data from 3 PEMFCs in 3 FCEVs carrying out postal mail delivery missions in the field. The results show that the proposed hybrid method can get higher accuracy than several traditional approaches.

                  In this paper, a rule learning based energy management strategy is proposed to achieve preferable energy consumption economy for fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles. Firstly, the optimal control sequence of fuel cell power and the state of charge trajectory of lithium-ion battery pack during driving are derived offline by the Pontryagin’s minimum principle. Next, the K-means algorithm is employed to hierarchically cluster the optimal solution into the simplified data set. Then, the repeated incremental pruning to produce error reduction algorithm, as a propositional rule learning strategy, is leveraged to learn and classify the underlying rules. Finally, the multiple linear regression algorithm is applied to fit the abstracted parameters of generated rule set. Simulation results highlight that the proposed strategy can achieve more than 95% savings of energy consumption economy, solved by Pontryagin’s minimum principle, with less calculation intensity and without dependence on prior driving conditions, thereby manifesting the feasibility of online application.

                  The gradual decline in global oil reserves and presence of ever so stringent emissions rules around the world, have created an urgent need for the production of automobiles with improved fuel economy. HEVs (hybrid electric vehicles) have proved a viable option to guaranteeing improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. The fuel consumption benefits which can be realised when utilising HEV architecture are dependent on how much braking energy is regenerated, and how well the regenerated energy is utilised. The challenge in developing an HEV control strategy lies in the satisfaction of often conflicting control constraints involving fuel consumption, emissions and driveability, without over-depleting the battery state of charge at the end of the defined driving cycle.
                  As a result, a number of power management strategies have been proposed in literature. This paper presents a comprehensive review of these literatures, focusing primarily on contributions in the aspect of parallel hybrid electric vehicle modelling and control. As part of this treatise, exploitable research gaps are also identified.

                  Considering the changeable driving conditions in reality, energy management strategies for fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles should be able to effectively distribute power demands under multiple driving patterns. In this paper, the development of an adaptive energy management strategy is presented, including a driving pattern recognizer and a multi-mode model predictive controller. In the supervisory level, the Markov pattern recognizer can classify the real-time driving segment into one of three predefined patterns. Based on the periodically updated pattern identification results, one set of pre-optimized control parameters is selected to formulate the multi-objective cost function. Afterwards, the desirable control policies can be obtained by solving a constrained optimization problem within each prediction horizon. Validation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Markov pattern recognizer, where at least 94.94% identification accuracy can be reached. Additionally, compared to a single-mode benchmark strategy, the proposed multi-mode strategy can reduce the average fuel cell power transients by over 87.00% under multi-pattern test cycles with a decrement of (at least) 2.07% hydrogen consumption, indicating the improved fuel cell system durability and the enhanced fuel economy.

                  Multi-mode hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have become popular in recent years because of their high efficiency and excellent overall performance. However, the introduction of multiple operating modes has led to some issues, e.g., mode shift problems, which are not observed in conventional HEVs with a single mode. Similar to a gear shift map in conventional vehicles, the mode shift map in multi-mode HEVs needs to be properly designed. In this study, the energy management algorithm of a multi-mode HEV is optimized using dynamic programming (DP) considering the mode shift frequency and energy losses. A mode shift map is then extracted from the operating points of the DP results using the support vector machine (SVM). By combining the derived mode shift map and the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS), a real-time control strategy is proposed for the online energy management of the multi-mode HEV. The results of a case study show the effectiveness of the proposed mode shift map and energy management strategy.

                  Vehicle energy economy is affected by different driving styles of individual drivers. To improve energy economy of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), it is of great importance to develop the driving style adaptive optimal control strategy. In fact, driving styles are often influenced and restricted by different driving cycles. Therefore, to recognize driving style more accurately, this paper decouples driving styles from driving cycles. Based on classification and identification of driving cycles, the accelerator pedal opening and its change rate in different driving cycles are analyzed and the fuzzy-logic recognizer is built to identify driving styles. Afterwards, the driving style adaptive optimal control strategy is realized by combining the recognized driving style with the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) and adopting a hybrid particle swarm optimization-genetic algorithm (PSO-GA) to optimize the relationship between the driving style and the equivalence factor (EF). The effectiveness of proposed driving style adaptive control strategy is validated by real vehicle test, which indicates that, compared with the original ECMS, the proposed driving style recognition based adaptive optimal control strategy improves the energy economy by 3.69% in the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). This adaptive optimal strategy provides guidance for incorporating driving style into PHEV energy management strategy to improve fuel economy.

                  Active sound quality control (ASQC) of vehicle interior noise is to reshape the sound spectrum by considering human perception. But current ASQC method mainly controls the interior noise amplitude, ignoring the time–frequency characteristics, and active control of sharpness is a problem. According to psychoacoustic indices, the original noise needs to be decomposed into subbands to obtain targeted control. Thus, this study presents a hybrid time–frequency domain active noise equalization (TFD-ANE) algorithm based on stationary discrete wavelet transform. For get a supporting effect, a variable step-size FxLMS (VS-FxLMS) and a normalized frequency-domain block FxLMS are inspected and determined for each subband noise suppression. It can be found NFB-FxLMS can control higher frequency noise well, while VS-FxLMS just shows better control effect on the lowest frequency subband. To verify the effectiveness of proposed method, ASQC simulations are performed by using the basic ANE, VS-ANE, NFB-ANE and TFD-ANE algorithms. Moreover, three psychoacoustic indices, loudness, sharpness, and roughness, with the utmost impact on the interior sound quality, are considered to quantify the noise improvement effect. Results show that TFD-ANE achieves the optimum performance, where the loudness and roughness are further reduced by more than 38% and 46% compared with other three algorithms. In terms of sharpness, the ANE and VS-ANE are ineffective, and the NFB-FxLMS cannot improve the sharpness of nonstationary interior noise. However, the proposed TFD-ANE can reduce the sharpness by approximately 40%, which suggests a promising approach to the ASQC of vehicle interior noises and other sound-related fields in engineering.

                  Power allocation is of crucial significance to energy management system in the hybrid construction machinery (HCM). Most of the existing HCM energy management strategies are only formulated based on the predefined rules, which causes the system unable to adapt to the changeable and complicated working conditions, thus seriously limiting the energy saving potential of hybrid technology. In this paper, we build a reinforcement learning-based intelligent energy management architecture for HCM. Given the working conditions and operating characteristics of HCM, a Q-function updating method combining direct learning and indirect learning is proposed to enhance the performance and practicability of reinforcement learning. A virtual world model (VWM) is introduced to approximate the real-world environment and facilitate the identification of data-driven environment, so as to enhance the real-time performance and adaptability of the architecture. Based on the characteristics of HCM working conditions, the load cycle is subdivided, and the stationary Markov chain is employed to yield real-time transfer probability matrices of required power to accelerate the updating of the environment model. An HCM experiment platform is built, in which the typical signal of working condition is sampled for simulation. The results indicate that DYNA-Q based architecture outperforms Q-learning and rule-based strategy (RBS) in terms of adaptivity, real-time performance and optimality. The results also demonstrate that with the proposed architecture, the working condition of internal combustion engine (ICE) and the charge-discharge of ultracapacitor are more rational and efficient.

                  The powertrain system of modern PEMFC based hybrid tramways typically contains a PEMFC system and a hybrid energy storage subsystem when combing a lithium-ion battery (LIB) modules with a supercapacitor (SC) bank. Based on the detailed analysis of stochastic uncertainties in tramway operation, a suboptimal real-time power sharing strategy considering operation uncertainties as well as fuel economy and system durability is proposed in this paper. The proposed energy management strategy consists of three modules, namely the fundamental real-time penalty power sharing module, the fuzzy-logic based differential power compensation module, and the Rainflow-based predictive SOC balancing module. Firstly, suboptimal real-time power sharing among different energy sources is achieved in the fundamental real-time penalty power sharing module. Secondly, a fuzzy-logic based differential power compensation module is designed to achieve the performance degradation balancing between PEMFCs and LIBs. Furthermore, a Rainflow-based predictive SOC balancing module is developed to realize adaptive updating concerning key parameters of the above two modules based on historical SOC information identification of SC subsystem and enhance the robustness to stochastic uncertainties. Detailed simulation results demonstrate that the proposed energy management strategy can guarantee operation stabilization of PEMFC based hybrid topologies throughout the simulated driving cycle. The influence of the proposed energy management strategy on the service life of the PEMFC subsystem and fuel economy of hybrid tramway is discussed in detail. Finally, the proposed energy management strategy with optimized PEMFC and HESS both decoupled topology is verified to be more suitable for PEMFC-based hybrid tramway applications with minimum equivalent hydrogen consumption and performance degradation balancing among hybrid energy sources, compared with other reductant hybrid configuration-based energy management strategies.

                  When the four-wheel-drive hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) equipped with a dry dual clutch transmission (DCT) is in the mode transition process from pure electrical rear wheel drive to front wheel drive with engine or hybrid drive, the problem of vehicle longitudinal jerk is prominent. A mode transition robust control algorithm which resists external disturbance and model parameter fluctuation has been developed, by taking full advantage of fast and accurate torque (or speed) response of three electrical power sources and getting the clutch of DCT fully involved in the mode transition process. Firstly, models of key components of driveline system have been established, and the model of five-degrees-of-freedom vehicle longitudinal dynamics has been built by using a Uni-Tire model. Next, a multistage optimal control method has been produced to realize the decision of engine torque and clutch-transmitted torque. The sliding-mode control strategy for measurable disturbance has been proposed at the stage of engine speed dragged up. Meanwhile, the double tracking control architecture that integrates the model calculating feedforward control with H∞ robust feedback control has been presented at the stage of speed synchronization. Finally, the results from Matlab/Simulink software and hardware-in-the-loop test both demonstrate that the proposed control strategy for mode transition can not only coordinate the torque among different power sources and clutch while minimizing vehicle longitudinal jerk, but also provide strong robustness to model uncertainties and external disturbance.

                  In-wheel motors (IWMs) substantially influence the output performance of electric vehicles (EVs). Size design and control issues are two critical factors to be explored. This paper proposes the use of hybridization for integrating dual motors to enhance EV system dynamics. A combined optimal sizing/control approach was developed using the global search method (GSM). The optimal control (torque ratio) of dual motors was first proposed using the nested-structure for-loop program to minimize the consumed power according to various power ratios. The next combined sizing/control developed using the GSM facilitated the search for the optimal control, power ratios, and T–N (Torque–Speed) ratios to minimize the accumulated energy consumed during ECE40 and UDDS driving cycles. The results from simulations of these two cycles indicated that the energy consumption during optimal control improved by 1.23% and 1.40%, 8.34% and 7.16% after optimal sizing, and the combined optimization improved total consumed energy by 15.31% and 15.16%, respectively. These results suggest that employing the novel hybrid IWM powertrains while using the combined sizing/control method can facilitate energy conservation. A real testing platform will be developed in the future.

The low-level layer exploits telemetry data over a short-term horizon in a model predictive control structure that provides the engine torque, but also the stop-start decision. The upper layer uses a tuning mechanism with a longer horizon to calculate the MPC weighting factor that ensures a balance between the fuel and battery consumption. An analysis of this upper-level tuning prediction horizon dependence on the drive cycle characteristics is performed. The robustness with respect to state-of-charge and engine torque estimation is also proven by a sensitivity analysis.

                  Increasing the low mileage associated with electric vehicles is a major requirement. Improving the efficiency of the traction motor is one solution to solve the mileage problem. In this study, we propose a method to improve the efficiency of a wound field synchronous motor (as the traction motor) in case of neighborhood electric vehicles. The wound field synchronous motor is a salient pole machine that generates a negative reluctance torque when operating in the second quadrant, reducing its efficiency. However, second quadrant operation is inevitable due to voltage limitation in the high-speed range. Here, we propose a hybrid circuit comprising U, V, W windings and X, Y, Z windings. The high-speed efficiency of the wound field synchronous motor is improved by changing the connection between the windings. Further, a neighborhood electric vehicle with a wound field synchronous motor was simulated using an advanced vehicle simulator (ADVISOR) to verify the proposal. The hybrid circuit increased the fuel economy of the electric vehicle by up to 3.8%. Finally, a validation experiment was conducted using a fabricated motor prototype.

                  This paper presents an energy management strategy for a hybrid electric propulsion system designed for unmanned aerial vehicles. The proposed method combines the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) and fuzzy logic control, thereby being named Fuzzy based ECMS (F-ECMS). F-ECMS can solve the issue that the conventional ECMS cannot sustain the battery state-of-charge for on-line applications. Furthermore, F-ECMS considers the aircraft safety and guarantees the aircraft landing using the remaining electrical energy if the engine fails. The main contribution of the paper is to solve the deficiencies of ECMS and take into consideration the aircraft safely landing, by implementing F-ECMS. Compared with the combustion propulsion system, the hybrid propulsion system with F-ECMS at least reduces 11% fuel consumption for designed flight missions. The advantages of F-ECMS are further investigated by comparison with the conventional ECMS, dynamic programming and adaptive ECMS. In contrast with ECMS and dynamic programming, F-ECMS can accomplish a balance between sustaining the battery state-of-charge and electric energy consumption. F-ECMS is also superior to the adaptive ECMS because there are less fuel consumption and lower computational cost.

                  Model checking procedures for verifying properties of hybrid dynamic systems are based on the construction of finite-state abstractions. If the property is not satisfied by the abstraction, the verification is inconclusive and the abstraction needs to be refined so that a less conservative model can be checked. If the hybrid system does not satisfy the property, this verify–refine procedure usually will not terminate. This paper introduces the concept of strong negation for ACTL formulas as an auxiliary condition that can be verified to obtain a conclusive negative verification result from a finite-state abstraction in certain cases. The concepts are illustrated with an example from automotive powertrain control.

This paper introduces the concept of strong negation for ACTL formulas as an auxiliary condition that can be verified to obtain a conclusive negative verification result from a finite-state abstraction in certain cases. The concepts are illustrated with an example from automotive powertrain control.

                  For the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) with repeated routes, the route information is very useful for energy optimization. SOC (state of charge) of power battery is the most important parameter for PHEV, so the information is usually utilized to calculate reference SOC. However, it is not the optimal trajectory, which might restrict the improvement of economic performance. In this paper, the route information is processed by dynamic programming and a group of optimal state of charge trajectories are obtained. Then, a novel state-of-charge-constraint-based cost function is firstly proposed, which can be obtained by presented method based on history cycle data. Next, a nonlinear model predictive controller is designed as energy management strategy to evaluate different cost functions. Experiment results show that proposed cost function can save fuel consumption by 5.9% and 10.8% compared with other two common cost functions.

                  Vehicles powered with internal combustion engines (ICEs) are one of the main pollutant sources in large cities. Most of large cities (e.g. Amman, capital of Jordan) suffer from frequent traffic jams. This leads to frequent stops and starts, and hence, an increase in tailpipe emissions. One way to minimize emissions is to use electric motors in the powertrain configuration. In this study, the performance of a hybrid fuel cell (FC)/battery vehicle is investigated utilizing different worldwide driving cycles. Initially, a model of a mid-sized ICE vehicle is developed and validated against experimental tests. The ICE vehicle validated model is then modified to be driven with only an electric motor powered by a hybrid FC/battery system. The effect of driving pattern, which varies from city to city and from region to region, is investigated. A driving cycle that represents the driving patterns in Amman city is developed based on experimental data and then used to evaluate the performance of both ICE and hybrid FC/battery vehicle configurations. It is found that the performance of the hybrid FC/battery configuration is much better than the ICE version in terms of emissions, fuel economy, efficiency, and speed tracking error.

                  This research evaluates the fuel economy of conventional and hybrid heavy vehicle combinations. The evaluation takes into account four heavy vehicle combinations with different total weights and three parallel hybrid configurations, which were developed for the tractor powertrain. The simulation models of conventional diesel powered and parallel hybrid vehicle combinations were developed in the Autonomie vehicle simulation software. Simulations were carried out in real-world operating routes that had been measured from popular truck routes in southern Finland. According to the simulations results, for one ton of additional weight to the total weight of the vehicle combination, the fuel consumption increases by 0.65–0.95l/100km depending on the operating route. The payload specific fuel consumption (the amount of fuel consumed per payload ton-kilometer) decreases on average 17% when total combination weight increases from 40t to 60t. The decrease is 23% when going from 40t to 76t and 28% when going from 40t to 90t. According to the simulation results, the fuel economy of a heavy vehicle combination can be improved by up to 6% by hybridization. The simulation results also indicate that the hybridization is more beneficial in operating routes which have more hill climbing.

                  In this study, a direct borohydride–peroxide fuel cell (DBPFC)–LiPo battery hybrid motorcycle, called HYBROTO, was developed. The hybrid system was designed using a 10-cell DBPFC stack with 120 W of maximum power as the main power source, a 12 LiPo battery pack with 6300 mAh and 65 C for energy storage and as auxiliary power source, and a brushless DC (BLDC) motor. In addition, a voltage-monitoring integrated circuit for fuel cells, a battery management unit, and a motor control circuit were developed to command the DBPFC, LiPo battery, and BLDC motor, respectively. The hybrid system was managed and synchronized by a main control unit (MCU) containing a synchronous bidirectional buck–boost converter and a boost converter. For performance tests, the DBPFC–battery system and BLDC motor were installed in an electric motorcycle body. Performance tests were carried out in the hybrid system under a constant load of 60 W. The hybrid system showed a satisfactory performance under the constant load with an efficiency of 67%. However, the MCU requires further improvement to provide more stable power output. The motorcycle prototype was tested at the 2016 International Symposium on Sustainable Aviation organized by the Sustainable Aviation Research Society.

                  Optimization of power management in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) with dual-power-source plays a critical role in achieving higher fuel economy and less pollutant emissions. In this study, power management and optimal control strategies in PHEVs have been investigated subject to uncertain driving cycles of individual drivers for particular trips. First, a stochastic driving cycle is constructed to more accurately model the dynamic characteristics of the uncertain driving cycles, derived from the historic record of individual drivers. Finite-horizon stochastic dynamic programming is adapted to globally optimize the vehicle performance in stochastic sense. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy significantly improves fuel economy, indicating the present optimization approach is very effective in exploring the potential of the hybridization of power train. A higher discretization of (that is, with smaller step sizes in) vehicle dynamics state variables (vehicle velocity, power demand and battery state of charge) has a positive impact on the fuel economy while the limitation of driving operability actually degrades the fuel economy. The commuting time with doubly truncated normal distribution slightly enhances the fuel economy in comparison with uniform distribution. In addition, there exists a tradeoff between the fuel economy and the pollutant emissions. These results could be utilized as a guideline for the design of PHEVs with different objectives.

                  By using the continuously variable transmission (CVT) to change the speed ratio continuously, the power resource components can operate in the high efficiency region for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) equipped with CVT, which improves the driving efficiency of powertrain. However, the frequent change of CVT speed ratio causes large energy loss of CVT hydraulic system and reduces the energy economy of PHEV. In view of this issue, the characteristic of energy loss for CVT hydraulic system is studied and the influence of speed ratio rate of change on energy loss of hydraulic system is obtained. Then, the simulation based on the continuously variable speed ratio control strategy (CVSRCS) is carried out and the results indicate that there is large energy loss of the CVT hydraulic system due to the frequent change of CVT speed ratio, which influences energy economy of the vehicle. Moreover, excessive driving jerk is generated, which significantly affects ride comfort of the vehicle. In order to reduce the adverse impact of frequent changes of CVT speed ratio on energy economy and ride comfort, a discretely variable speed ratio control strategy (DVSRCS) is proposed and discrete speed ratio is optimized by genetic algorithm.

                  In the attempt to improve urban environmental conditions, city or national incentives encourage the use of cleaner vehicles, including hybrid electric vehicles. This paper explores the actual noise impact of this alternative drivetrain technology on the noise emission of a mid-size delivery truck powered by a parallel hybrid powertrain, compared with an equivalent internal combustion engine truck on the basis of pass-by noise measurements. It investigates jointly the overall emission, the main noise sources and the vertical directivity of the vehicle. The essential benefit results from the existence of a full-electric mode below 50km/h, with a significant noise reduction which may exceed 8dB(A) at low constant speed. Even if smaller, this noise advantage is still valuable when the vehicle is accelerating or braking. Due to weaker noise emitted upwards, the benefit should be even greater for residents living on upper building floors. The rolling noise associated with the drive wheel/road contact is the main noise source in all driving situations in electric mode, and beyond 50km/h in the configurations with engine.

Combined analytical and simulation approach was applied to analyze energy conversion efficiency of different HEV topologies. Analytical approach is based on the energy balance equations and considers all energy paths in the HEVs from the energy sources to the wheels and to other energy sinks. Simulation approach is based on a fast forward-facing simulation model for simulating parallel and series HEVs as well as for conventional internal combustion engine vehicles, and considers all components relevant for modeling energy conversion phenomena. Combined approach enables evaluation of energy losses on different energy paths and provides their impact on the fuel economy. It therefore enables identification of most suitable HEV topology and of most suitable power ratios of the components for targeted vehicle application, since it reveals and quantifies the mechanisms that could lead to improved energy conversion efficiency of particular HEV. The paper exposes characteristics of the test cycles that lead to improved energy conversion efficiency of HEVs.

                  This paper investigates an online predictive control strategy for series-parallel plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), resulting in a novel online optimization methodology named the dual-loop online intelligent programming (DOIP) that is proposed for velocity prediction and energy-flow control. By reconsidering the change of driving behaviours at each look-ahead step, this methodology guarantees the effectiveness of optimal control sequence in the energy-saving efficiency of online predictive energy management. The design procedure starts with the simulation of a series-parallel PHEV using a systematic control-oriented model and the definition of a cost function. Inspired by fuzzy granulation technology, a deep fuzzy predictor is created to achieve driver-oriented velocity prediction, and a finite-state Markov chain is exploited to learn transition probabilities between vehicle speed and acceleration. To determine the optimal control behaviours and power distribution between two energy sources, chaos-enhanced accelerated swarm optimization is developed for the DOIP algorithm. The prediction capability of the deep fuzzy predictor is evaluated by comparing with two existing predictors over the WLTP-based driving cycle. The proposed control strategy is contrasted with short-sighted and dynamic programming based counterparts, and validated by a driver-in-the-loop test. The results demonstrate that the deep fuzzy predictor can effectively recognize driving behaviour and reduce at least 19% errors compared to involved Markov chain based predictors. Online predictive control strategy using the DOIP algorithm is able to significantly reduce 9.37% fuel consumption from the baseline and shorten computational time.

                  Hybrid vehicles can use energy storage systems to disconnect the engine from the driving wheels of the vehicle. This enables the engine to be run closer to its optimum operating condition, but fuel energy is still wasted through the exhaust system as heat. The use of a turbogenerator on the exhaust line addresses this problem by capturing some of the otherwise wasted heat and converting it into useful electrical energy.
                  This paper outlines the work undertaken to model the engine of a diesel-electric hybrid bus, coupled with a hybrid powertrain model which analysed the performance of a hybrid vehicle over a drive-cycle. The distribution of the turbogenerator power was analysed along with the effect on the fuel consumption of the bus. This showed that including the turbogenerator produced a 2.4% reduction in fuel consumption over a typical drive-cycle.
                  The hybrid bus generator was then optimised to improve the performance of the combined vehicle/engine package and the turbogenerator was then shown to offer a 3.0% reduction in fuel consumption. The financial benefits of using the turbogenerator were also considered in terms of fuel savings for operators. For an average bus, a turbogenerator could reduce fuel costs by around £1200 per year.

                  The efficiency of internal combustion engines (ICEs) is well-known to be low at cold starting conditions. Additionally, the energy demand for passenger compartment heating is substantial and either provided by an electrical auxiliary heater or in terms of the engine waste heat. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are prone to suffer from extended warm-up periods due to increased engine off periods as compared to conventional vehicles. Energy management strategies (EMSs) however allow for warm-up applications independent of the drive torque request. Optimal control theory serves as benchmark for EMS, offering a variety of numerical methods. This paper focuses on forward dynamic programming (FDP) accounting for causal system dynamics such as engine temperature. Results confirm, that even though the fuel saving potential of the engine warm-up is significant, it is hardly influenced by means of the EMS. A second implementation variant is proposed to counteract the curse of dimensionality. The presented approach not entirely achieves global optimality, yet yields results close to optimum within reasonable computational times. As opposed to the reference, the proposed method allows accounting for a variety of causal system dynamics leading towards an EMS more close to reality.

                  There are several advantages in keeping motor drive DC input voltage stable around its nominal value especially when it comes to minimize losses. This paper deals with the stability enhancement of the motor drive DC input voltage of an electric vehicle with on-board hybrid energy storage system. On one hand, the natural voltage variation at the output battery pack can be avoided by using a DC/DC converter connected between the battery and the motor drive. On the other hand, the incorporation of supercapacitors in small urban electric vehicles enables handling power peaks thus reducing the battery current root-mean-square value, which in turn increases the battery lifetime. Several topologies can be considered for the coupling of supercapacitors with the vehicle energy system. In this paper, three topologies are studied: battery-only, direct hybrid coupling, and active parallel hybrid coupling of batteries and supercapacitors. A reduced-scale power level hardware-in-the-loop test-bench has been built to analyze the performance of the hybrid topologies under the ARTEMIS driving cycle. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the active parallel configuration controlled by an improved energy management strategy that dynamically regulates the supercapacitors state-of-charge. The analysis performed demonstrates that the use of this configuration coupled with an improved management strategy can increase the power transferred by 80% compared with a battery-only configuration, and by 40% compared with direct hybrid coupling or active parallel coupling configuration with a traditional management strategy, keeping the voltage stability of the DC Link.

                  Energy management is a fundamental task in hybrid electric vehicle community. Efficient energy management of hybrid electric vehicle is challenging owning to its enormous search space, multitudinous control variables and complicated driving conditions. Most existing methods apply discretization to approximate the continuous optimum in real driving conditions, which results in relatively low performance with the discretization error and curse of dimensionality. We introduce a novel energy management strategy with a deep reinforcement learning framework Actor-Critic to address these challenges. Actor-Critic uses a deep neural network, named as actor network, to directly output continuous control signals. Another deep neural network, named as critic network, evaluates the control signals generated by the actor network.The actor and critic neural network are trained by reinforcement learning from self-play in a continuous action space. Several comprehensive experiments are conducted in this paper, the proposed method surpasses discretization-based strategies by directly optimizing in the continuous space, which improves energy management performance while blackucing computation load. The simulation results indicate that the AC achieve the optimal energy distribution in comparison with the discretization-based strategies, especially surpassing the existing baseline DP by 5.5

                  An energy optimization control strategy for the Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) is developed in this paper to reduce the fuel consumption, on the premise of the operation demand, which makes the engine and motor working in the high efficiency operation area. The energy management model of Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) for the parallel hybrid vehicle is set up, the state of charge (SOC) and the output power of the battery are chosen as the state variable and control variable, respectively. The total fuel consumption during the HEV operation is considered as the objective function, and PMP is used to obtain the optimum solution. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the developed control strategy, with which the higher output torque of the engine and the lower output torque and higher efficiency of the motor are achieved compared with the energy management strategy based on logic rule.

                  With the drastic inclination towards reduction of atmospheric issues, hybrid electric vehicles are becoming the major alternative for internal combustion engine vehicles. Compared to internal combustion engine vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles are remarkable in terms of efficiency, durability and acceleration capability. However, the major drawback of hybrid electric vehicle is energy storage capability. An electric vehicle requires the energy sources with high specific power (W/kg) and high specific energy (Wh/kg) to reduce the charging time. Generally, fuel cells, batteries, ultracapacitors, flywheels and regenerative braking systems are used in hybrid electric vehicles as energy sources and energy storage devices. All these energy storage devices are connected to the different DC-DC converter topologies to increase the input source voltage. From the recent past, most of the hybrid electric vehicles are using multi-input converters to connect more than one energy source in order to improve the efficiency and reliability of the vehicle. This survey presents an assessment of present and future trend of energy storage devices and different multi-input DC-DC converter topologies that are being used in hybrid electric vehicles. In addition, different electric vehicle architectures are also discussed.

                  The purpose of this study is to investigate possible improvements in ICEVs by implementing fuzzy logic-based parallel hard-type power hybrid systems. Two types of conventional ICEVs (gasoline and diesel) and two types of HEVs (gasoline-electric, diesel electric) were generated using vehicle and powertrain simulation tools and a Matlab-Simulink application programming interface. For gasoline and gasoline-electric HEV vehicles, the prediction accuracy for four types of LDV models was validated by conducting comparative analysis with the chassis dynamometer and OBD test data. The predicted results show strong correlation with the test data. The operating points of internal combustion engines and electric motors are well controlled in the high efficiency region and battery SOC was well controlled within ±1.6%. However, for diesel vehicles, we generated virtual diesel-electric HEV vehicle because there is no available vehicles with similar engine and vehicle specifications with ICE vehicle. Using a fuzzy logic-based parallel hybrid system in conventional ICEVs demonstrated that HEVs showed superior performance in terms of fuel consumption and CO2 emission in most driving modes.

                  When developing an energy management strategy (EMS) including a battery aging model for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, the trade-off between the energy consumption cost (ECC) and the equivalent battery life loss cost (EBLLC) should be considered to minimize the total cost of both and improve the life cycle value. Unlike EMSs with a lower State of Charge (SOC) boundary value given in advance, this paper proposes a model predictive control of EMS based on an optimal battery depth of discharge (DOD) for a minimum sum of ECC and EBLLC. First, the optimal DOD is identified using Pontryagin's Minimum Principle and shooting method. Then a reference SOC is constructed with the optimal DOD, and a model predictive controller (MPC) in which the conflict between the ECC and EBLC is optimized in a moving horizon is implemented. The proposed EMS is examined by real-world driving cycles under different preview horizons, and the results indicate that MPCs with a battery aging model lower the total cost by 1.65%, 1.29% and 1.38%, respectively, for three preview horizons (5, 10 and 15 s) under a city bus route of about 70 km, compared to those unaware of battery aging. Meanwhile, global optimization algorithms like the dynamic programming and Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, as well as a rule-based method, are compared with the predictive controller, in terms of computational expense and accuracy.

                  The paper proposes a simulation approach to evaluate the power required by a rotorcraft in standard flight missions and in emergency landing maneuvers, and the corresponding fuel consumption, in order to compare the feasibility and potential fuel savings for different hybrid power systems. More in detail, three options are analyzed, namely electrification of the tail rotor, fully hybrid electric propulsion and electric emergency landing. Weight penalty and potential fuel saving for the proposed hybridization schemes are evaluated for an Agusta-Westland A109 twin engine helicopter model. Nonetheless the discussed methods of analysis have general validity for single main rotor helicopter configurations.
                  Two different scenarios are considered in this investigation: current technologies for batteries and motors and improved electrical components, with performance projections as of 2040. According to this analysis, electrification of the tail rotor and parallel hybridization are feasible with available technology, whereas a fully electrical power system for emergency landing could be developed only in the future. Finally, a parallel hybrid electric power system is sized according to the analysis of power request over four different missions.

These circumstances where autonomous and controlled state jumps at the switching instants are accompanied by changes in the dimension of the state space are reflected in the definition of hybrid systems and the corresponding statement of the Hybrid Minimum Principle (HMP). Furthermore, the state-dependent motor torque constraints which impose mixed input-state constraints are converted to state-independent input constraints via a change of variables and the introduction of auxiliary discrete states.

                  The application of fuel cell hybrid construction equipment (FCHCE) represents an attractive option for future industrial development. Construction equipment has highly repetitive modes of operation, which can be used for predictive control. However, the loads usually change markedly and frequently, leading to adverse scenarios for energy management. In this paper, we focus on alleviating this problem by presenting a predictive energy management strategy based on a model predictive control (MPC) framework for FCHCE. The supervisory-level energy management objectives are to respond to rapid variations in the load of the construction equipment while minimizing the fuel consumption, improving fuel cell durability, and maintaining the state of charge (SoC) of supercapacitors within the allowable bounds. To improve the performance and practicality of the predictive controllers, we present two power demand prediction methodologies based on Markov chains and neural networks. Simulations are carried out on the representative driving cycles of a wheel loader. Simulation results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed MPC. Neural network model made better predictions than the Markov chain model, which is preferable when modeling comprehensive driving cycles.

                  A systematic framework based on a creative mechanism design methodology and the lever analogy method is proposed for the synthesis of two-mode hybrid transmission systems comprising 3 planetary gears, 9 links and 14 joints. In the proposed approach, the topological characteristics of existing hybrid transmissions are examined and processes of generalization and number synthesis are performed to construct an atlas of generalized kinematic chains. The atlas of feasible kinematic chains is then obtained by applying the specified design requirements and constraints. Based on the required operating modes of the hybrid transmission, the lever analogy method is employed to determine all possible placements of the inputs, output, clutches and brakes of the synthesized configurations. Finally, existing configurations are eliminated in order to obtain the final atlas of new hybrid transmission designs. Utilizing the GM hybrid transmission system for existing hybrid transmissions, a total of 17 novel two-mode hybrid transmissions are obtained. The feasibility of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by performing a detailed kinematic analysis of one of the synthesized transmissions.

The dynamics and boundary models for two commercially available and controllable dampers are then presented. Both dampers in the suspension and the DVAS are used to allocate the hybrid control force synthesized depend on the system responses. Simulation results for excitations of both random road and bump input are finally analyzed, and the proposed hybrid controller can simultaneously improve ride comfort and reduce IWM vibration compared to the traditional suspension system.

                  The fuel cell hybrid vehicle provides an efficient and low-emission alternative for the internal combustion engine vehicle. The energy management strategy (EMS) commands the power split between the power sources and is crucial to the hybrid vehicles. In this work, we propose an adaptive EMS based on Pontryagin's Minimal Principle for a fuel cell/battery hybrid vehicle, in which the co-state adaptation is performed by driving cycle prediction. In order to improve the co-state estimation accuracy, an improved Markov based velocity prediction is proposed considering the driving behavior under different driving patterns. Moreover, the driving pattern is recognized online based on a support vector machine method, which is optimized by particle swarm optimization. We build a combined driving cycle to verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, simulation results under three cases show that the proposed strategy can foresee the driving behaviors and update the co-state reasonably. Comparing with the rule-based EMS, the proposed strategy achieves a better fuel economy with a hydrogen consumption reduction by 4% and a relatively low average power change rate of fuel cells. Moreover, it achieves a close performance to the offline optimal algorithms.

In order to establish the hybrid engine, firstly, efficiency graphs of the electrical motor were obtained experimentally. The battery charge status was also checked.

                  Power required to run auxiliary systems on a passenger car, such as those for air conditioning and advanced vehicle control, reduces the driving range of a vehicle equipped with a hybrid drive train. Under practical driving conditions, a significant amount of additional energy is required at low power levels compared to the rated power of the drive unit. In the present study, we consider a fuel cell-battery drive train augmented by an on-board fuel (ethanol) processor to provide the motoring power requirements of a car. Using systematic driving cycle simulations that take account of power-to-weight, energy-to-weight and power-to-efficiency factors of on-board power sources under simulated load conditions, we show that a combination of steadily-operated compact ethanol reformer, a low-power battery continuously charged by excess reformer capacity and a high-power fuel cell powered by conservatively-used hydrogen from cylinder can increase the range of hybrid fuel cell drivetrains to about 750 km. Although the overall energy consumption of the three-way hybrid is more than that of fuel cell-battery hybrid, lesser use of stored hydrogen improves the fuel economy of the hybrid drivetrain. While the system complexity is increased, long-range distressed mode operation becomes feasible with the added fuel processor.

                  Hybrid powertrains are considered to be a promising method to raise the overall fuel efficiency of passenger cars. They are predicted to enter the automobile markets in increasing numbers in the near future. This paper investigates 2 aspects relevant to the promotion of hybrid vehicles as part of an energy reduction strategy. First, are hybrid cars accompanied by rebound effects, which counteract their increased fuel efficiency? Second, do tax rebates indeed lead to higher sales numbers? We present results from a survey conducted with all 367 buyers of hybrid second-generation Toyota Prius in Switzerland in the first 9 months after market entry (response rate, 82.6%). As control group, questionnaires were also sent to 250 Toyota Corolla (61% returned) and 250 Toyota Avensis (52%) buyers. Among other items, the surveys asked for the car being replaced, if any. Main results are that the increase in car size for hybrid car buyers was lower than both, the market trend and the control group. Increase in car size was lower for hybrid car buyers than for both control group and market trend. 6% of hybrid car purchases did not replace a previously owned vehicle (control group 3%, P
                     =0.05), the Swiss market average being 20%. Hence rebound effects could be identified neither for vehicle size nor for vehicle ownership. As an energy policy measure, hybrid vehicles are eligible for tax rebates in parts of Switzerland. We found evidence that these tax rebates indeed lead to significant higher sales. We present a rough cost estimate of such tax rebates as CO2 abatement policy tool.

                  Sheet-bulk metal forming is an expedient approach to efficiently manufacture functional components out of sheet metal. In order to reduce weight of the component manufactured, an application-adapted approach was developed to replace the conventional steel blank by a semi-finished product consisting of two blanks with half the thickness to enable the tailored combination of different materials in a combined deep drawing and upsetting process. To establish a basis for the application of these hybrid semi-finished products, first of all multilayer steel semi-finished products are drawn and upset in the process combination. Thereby, the upsetting process induces a three dimensional material flow and at the same time an interlocking connection of the two blanks. The gained results are the transferred onto the combination of steel and aluminium alloys within one semi-finished product. Fundamental dependencies as well as the influence of the application of different steel grades are investigated.

                  Offering high efficiency and producing zero emissions Fuel Cells (FCs) represent an excellent alternative to internal combustion engines for powering vehicles to alleviate the growing pollution in urban environments. Due to inherent limitations of FCs which lead to slow transient response, FC-based vehicles incorporate an energy storage system to cover the fast power variations. This paper considers a FC/supercapacitor platform that configures a hard constrained powertrain providing an adverse scenario for the energy management strategy (EMS) in terms of fuel economy and drivability. Focusing on palliating this problem, this paper presents a novel EMS based on the estimation of short-term future energy demand and aiming at maintaining the state of energy of the supercapacitor between two limits, which are computed online. Such limits are designed to prevent active constraint situations of both FC and supercapacitor, avoiding the use of friction brakes and situations of non-power compliance in a short future horizon. Simulation and experimentation in a case study corresponding to a hybrid electric bus show improvements on hydrogen consumption and power compliance compared to the widely reported Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy. Also, the comparison with the optimal strategy via Dynamic Programming shows a room for improvement to the real-time strategies.

                  The series hybrid electric tracked bulldozer (HETB)’s fuel economy heavily depends on its energy management strategy. This paper presents a model predictive controller (MPC) to solve the energy management problem in an HETB for the first time. A real typical working condition of the HETB is utilized to develop the MPC. The results are compared to two other strategies: a rule-based strategy and a dynamic programming (DP) based one. The latter is a global optimization approach used as a benchmark. The effect of the MPC’s parameters (e.g. length of prediction horizon) is also studied. The comparison results demonstrate that the proposed approach has approximately a 6% improvement in fuel economy over the rule-based one, and it can achieve over 98% of the fuel optimality of DP in typical working conditions. To show the advantage of the proposed MPC and its robustness under large disturbances, 40% white noise has been added to the typical working condition. Simulation results show that an 8% improvement in fuel economy is obtained by the proposed approach compared to the rule-based one.

                  The present investigation addresses the problem of evaluating the endurance of hybrid electric aircraft and discusses the effect of battery specifications and the engine working points on fuel economy. In particular, the endurance per unit mass of fuel of a hybrid power system is calculated by assuming a constant power-level flight performed with alternate cycles of battery charging and discharging (ON-OFF strategy). The computation of the fuel economy requires accurate models for the time, the power and the energy associated with battery charging and discharge processes. In order to reach this goal, two approaches proposed in literature to evaluate electric endurance were discussed, amended and validated through comparison with experimental data. A model for constant-current/constant voltage battery charge was also presented and validated with literature experimental data. In order to explain how these models can be applied to real applications, a parallel hybrid power system was sized and analyzed for a medium-altitude long-endurance unmanned aerial vehicle. Lithium polymer batteries and two stroke diesel engines were considered and three different hybridization degrees were analyzed. The results showed a trade-off between electric flight time and overall endurance per unit mass of fuel and an improvement up to 12% in fuel consumption with respect to a non-hybrid case with the same engine.

                  To evaluate real-world energy consumption and tail-pipe emissions of current plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), we tested three PHEVs in different driving conditions. We considered measurements of emissions at different ambient temperatures and for various operating conditions regarding hybridization. The results show that the initial battery state-of-charge (SoC) determines the absolute CO2 emissions as CO2 emissions decrease with a higher proportion of electric driving. Therefore, the use of different hybrid driving strategies can have a strong influence on the overall fuel-saving potential. This does not apply to other pollutants such as NOx and particles, as the emission of these pollutants depends on the operating conditions of the internal combustion engine. RDE tests with a high proportion of electric driving show, in some cases, higher pollutant emissions than in tests with a low electric share. In general, the emission measurements done under real driving conditions show a higher variance compared to the test bench tests. In the case of PHEVs, this effect is further increased due to the different choice of driving modes and engine cold starts during electric driving. The variance of these parameters makes it difficult to estimate the emission benefits of PHEVs.

A shiftable transmission, e.g., a continuously variable transmission (CVT), allowing a smooth and continuous transition between the powertrain operation points further optimizes the energy usage, yet also allows further the reduction of the electric machine (Nm/W) and transmission specifications (overall speed ratio) in comparison with an optimized fixed-gear transmission. Moreover, a CVT enables for autonomous driving electric vehicles to further increase the driving range without compromising the vehicle performance. The influence of the transmission type, losses and driving conditions (average speed) are investigated for an EV of which the travelled distance, velocity and speed ratio (for the CVT) are the controlled states.

                  This paper presents a new integrated model predictive control (IMPC) method that combines power management and adaptive velocity control during vehicle-following scenarios in reality, for a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). Innovatively, the IMPC is able to plan the battery state of charge (SOC) and vehicular velocity trajectories, in order to improve fue economy and driving safety. To assess the performance of the IMPC, a comparison is performed with common charge-depleting and charge-sustaining (CDCS) and DP-based energy management strategies, where an improved full velocity difference model (IFVDM) is incorporated to simulate vehicle-following behavior. These solutions are examined using a real-world driving cycle. The results reveal an enormous potential of flexibly tuning the inter-vehicle distance to increase fuel economy. This is distinct from the rigid vehicle-following behavior of the IFVDM just for driving safety. Moreover, the proposed IMPC can ensure the battery charge depletion at the end of the trip. The quantitative results witness that the total cost of the IMPC with a preview horizon of 3s can be reduced by 17.9% and 36.1% for a 70 km city-bus route, compared to IFVDM-based DP and CDCS counterparts, respectively.

               ","el predictive control (IMPC) method that combines power management and adaptive velocity control during vehicle-following scenarios in reality, for a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). Innovatively, the IMPC is able to plan the battery state of charge (SOC) and vehicular velocity trajectories, in order to improve fue economy and driving safety. To assess the performance of the IMPC, a comparison is performed with common charge-depleting and charge-sustaining (CDCS) and DP-based energy management strategies, where an improved full velocity difference model (IFVDM) is incorporated to simulate vehicle-following behavior. These solutions are examined using a real-world driving cycle. The results reveal an enormous potential of flexibly tuning the inter-vehicle distance to increase fuel economy. This is distinct from the rigid vehicle-following behavior of the IFVDM just for driving safety. Moreover, the proposed IMPC can ensure the battery charge depletion at the end of the trip.

                  In this paper, a real time energy management strategy (EMS) is proposed for a dual-mode power-split hybrid electric vehicle in order to improve the fuel economy and maintain proper battery’s state of charge (SOC) while satisfying all the constraints and the driving demands. The EMS employs a cascaded control concept which includes a velocity predictor, a master controller and a slave controller. The short term vehicle velocity predictor is developed to improve the controller performance based on radial basis function neural network. The master controller based on nonlinear model predictive control is developed with slow sampling time to sustain SOC and to reduce fuel consumption. Forward dynamic programming is employed here to solve the optimal problem. And the PID-based slave controller is developed with fast sampling time to coordinate the engine and the two motors. Simulation and testbed experiments are performed to verify it and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared with other methods.

                  For a power-split hybrid transmission, using the brake clutch to realize the transition from electric drive mode to hybrid drive mode is an available strategy. Since the pressure information of the brake clutch is essential for the mode transition control, this research designs a nonlinear robust reduced-order observer to estimate the brake clutch pressure. Model uncertainties or disturbances are considered as additional inputs, thus the observer is designed in order that the error dynamics is input-to-state stable. The nonlinear characteristics of the system are expressed as the lookup tables in the observer. Moreover, the gain matrix of the observer is solved by two optimization procedures under the constraints of the linear matrix inequalities. The proposed observer is validated by offline simulation and online test, the results have shown that the observer achieves significant performance during the mode transition, as the estimation error is within a reasonable range, more importantly, it is asymptotically stable.

                  Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) can potentially reduce vehicle fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by using recuperated kinetic vehicle energy stored as electric energy in a hybrid system battery (HSB). Low ambient temperatures can affect the overall HEV powertrain operation under warm-up and hot driving conditions and, consequently, affect fuel consumption and emission performance. The present study investigates the influence of low ambient temperatures on HEV fuel consumption and pollutant and CO2 emissions for five in-use HEV models. Chassis dynamometer measurements have been conducted at different set ambient temperatures using a real-world driving cycle suitable for investigating vehicle cold-start emissions. The main observation is that the amount of HEV cold-start extra emissions (CSEEs) of regulated pollutants are reduced by 30% to 85% on average in comparison to sample CSEEs of conventional gasoline vehicles. The results for HEV CSEEs of CO2 and fuel consumption are mainly similar than those of conventional gasoline vehicles except for CSEEs of some HEVs at the ambient temperature of 23°C. There, increased CSEEs are observed that exceed maximum sample CSEEs of conventional gasoline vehicles, reaching values for CO2 between 155 [g/start] and 300 [g/start] even though the test runs were initiated with maximum initial state of charge (SOC) of the HSB. Because SOC of the HSB considerably influences the fuel consumption of HEVs, this aspect should be further investigated in regard to the effect of low ambient temperatures on HEV fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Moreover, no particular influence of low ambient temperatures on HSB performance was observed during hot-phase operation.

                  Piezoelectric actuators play a crucial role in both scientific research and industrial applications. With the increasing demand on the high speed performance piezoelectric actuators, various inertial flexible piezoelectric actuators driven by sawtooth wave based on the stick slip principle have been proposed to satisfy the requirement, but the problem of low speed performance commonly exists. This paper proposes a direction-guidance hybrid (DGH) excitation method which can overcome the limitation. The excitation method is achieved by a direction-guidance hybrid (DGH) wave. Different from the existing excitation methods, not only the DGH wave can make the actuator produce a pre-deformation which can guide the slider to move and adjust the locking force, but also can drive the actuator to move with high speed even at a low voltage. In order to verify the excitation method, a novel inertial flexible hinge piezoelectric actuator is designed and manufactured. Furthermore, the finite element method (FEM) and experiments are conducted to detect the superior high speed performance of the prototype driven by the proposed excitation method. Compared with the existing actuators, the prototype driven by the DGH excitation method, even at less than 1/10 of input voltage, can achieve a 1.5 times higher speed.

                  This brief proposes a real-time energy management approach for a hybrid tracked vehicle to adapt to different driving conditions. To characterize different route segments online, an onboard learning algorithm for Markov Chain models is employed to generate transition probability matrices of power demand. The induced matrix norm is presented as an initialization criterion to quantify differences between multiple transition probability matrices and to determine when to update them at specific road segment. Since a series of control policies are available onboard for the hybrid tracked vehicle, the induced matrix norm is also employed to choose an appropriate control policy that matches the current driving condition best. To accelerate the convergence rate in Markov Chain-based control policy computation, a reinforcement learning-enabled energy management strategy is derived by using speedy Q-learning algorithm. Simulation is carried out on two driving cycles. And results indicate that the proposed energy management strategy can greatly improve the fuel economy and be employed in real-time when compared with the stochastic dynamic programming and conventional RL approaches.

                  Governments apply economic motivating forces and penalties to manage environmental effects of enterprises. Therefore, companies and manufactures will need to move toward environmental and sustainability assessment to survive and remain competitive in market.
                  We consider market demands so that non-green and green products can be substituted with each other. If green products cannot overwhelm the market, manufacturers might select hybrid production mode including green and regular products. The government acts as a leader and sets special tariffs for non-green and green products as a controlling tool. We formulate a game theoretical model in twelve scenarios based on government policies and different types of production modes of a supply chain (SC). We calculate the optimal tariffs, selling prices, and prices of raw materials. The results indicate that environmental protection strategy of government has significant impact on the government revenue and profit of the SC’s members. Moreover, the profits of a centralized SC is higher than a decentralized SC. When the government chooses the environmental protection and revenue seeking policies, the profit functions of the government and members of SC increase in centralized scenarios under hybrid production mode. Besides, it can be seen that Hybrid production mode has positive role on participating enterprises. Results also show that when government focuses on increasing income, the environmental impacts of SCs will increase in both decentralized and centralized SCs.

                  Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) equipped with dual clutch transmission (DCT) can benefit from engine auxiliary braking force and driving motor regenerative braking force in braking conditions. This can effectively reduce the workload of hydraulic mechanical braking systems and recovery braking energy, which will improve the fuel economy. In the downshift process, the driving motor is involved to response the change of torque/speed demand, which can further improve the shift quality of DCT without affecting the engine emissions and fuel economy. The combined braking condition of HEVs with DCT allows for the variation of power distribution between the front and rear axle, as well as the electric and hydraulic braking force. In this study, the downshift decision strategy is designed based on the two-parameter shift schedule, while considering the driver’s subjective driving intention. Subsequently, the mathematical model developed to investigate the downshift process of HEVs with dual clutch transmission has been applied to skip downshift process, to analyze the control sequence and implement different control algorithms according to respective control objects. Specifically, the sliding mode variable structure optimization control algorithm is used to allow the engine speed to track the target value in the torque phase. In addition, the linear quadratic tracking controller and the model reference adaptive system are used, based on adjustable parameters, to realize the speed synchronization of the clutch driving and driven plate in the inertial phase. According to the results of electro-hydraulic braking force distribution, the braking forces of an integrated starter generator (ISG) motor and hydraulic brake system are controlled to switch to the demand level. Then, the simulation model established on a Matlab/Simulink platform is used to validate the skip downshift control strategy. Finally, the designed control strategies are verified on the test bench. The test results demonstrate that the established shift control strategy can achieve the target power downshift under braking conditions, and have a good downshift quality, which lays a foundation for subsequent development and real vehicle tests.

                  This paper presents an innovative application of the hybrid model predictive control (HMPC) scheme to optimally regulate the intelligent vehicle longitudinal velocity. For autonomous velocity regulation, the intelligent vehicle needs to be operated in two distinct modes (drive and brake) and because of the mode-dependent constraints on accelerations and decelerations by considering the comfort of passengers, the intelligent vehicle longitudinal dynamics control process can be regarded as a constrained hybrid dynamical system. Thus, in this study, the intelligent vehicle longitudinal dynamics is approximated as a two-mode discrete-time mixed logical dynamical (MLD) system. Using this approximation, a hybrid model predictive controller, which allows us to optimize the switching sequences of the operation modes (binary control inputs) and the torques acted on the wheels (continuous control inputs), is tuned based on online mixed-integer quadratic programming. Numerical simulation analysis is conducted for a sport utility vehicle to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method. Finally, the explicit representation of the HMPC is computed to control the intelligent vehicle in real-time, and the experimental results are presented to show the applicability of the proposed controller.

                  Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) significantly improve vehicle fuel efficiency compared to conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and also eliminate the “range anxiety” associated with battery-only electric vehicles (BEVs). This paper develops a simple PHEV energy consumption model that can be used in a real-time in-vehicle and smartphone eco-driving application, an eco-routing navigation system, and/or a microscopic traffic simulation software. The majority of PHEV studies have centered on the evaluation of energy consumption to analyze vehicle control strategies or the behavior of the battery system assuming an average constant value for the regenerative braking energy efficiency or regenerative braking factors that are principally dependent on the vehicle’s average speed. The proposed series PHEV energy consumption model estimates a PHEV’s instantaneous energy consumption using second-by-second vehicle speed, acceleration, and roadway grade data as input variables accounting for the regenerative braking efficiency using instantaneous vehicle parameters. The model developed in this study computes the vehicle’s energy consumption producing an average error of 4% relative to independently collected field data. Results show that PHEVs can recover a higher amount of energy in urban driving when compared to high speed highway driving. Finally, it is important to highlight the fact that this model is flexible and general and thus can model different PHEVs as there is no need for efficiency maps for the electric motor or the internal combustion engine.

                  Ultra-lean burn combustion can significantly improve the fuel economy of gasoline engines. However, poor combustion stability and slow combustion need to be solved. Therefore, micro-flame ignited (MFI) hybrid combustion, a concept that ultra-lean gasoline is burned with compression auto-ignition of direct injection (DI) dimethyl ether (DME) in the cylinder, was employed. The effect of single and double DI DME strategies on the combustion characteristics and flame structures was investigated in an optical gasoline engine at lambda 2.0. The results show that the heat release process in the case of single DI DME consists of oxidation reactions of DME (stage I) and hybrid combustion of DME and gasoline (stage II). In the case of double DI DME, there is gasoline auto-ignition (stage III) after stages I and II. The ignition timing delays with decreased heat released in stage I regardless of DI strategies. Indicated mean effective pressure can be enhanced and the cyclic variation is reduced in the double DI conditions. The flame brightness increases with increased heat release rate regardless of DI DME strategies. The decay rate of turbulent flame propagation speed in double DI conditions is slower than that in single DI conditions, which improves combustion stability.

The results demonstrate that the battery plays a crucial role in the response to dynamic load changes and that this system response is strongly influenced by the battery's capacity and current rating. The results also demonstrate that the power-management board of the AeroStack only recharges the battery to at most 70% of its capacity and charging can take up to nearly 2 h. As the recharging requires fuel consumption by the fuel cell, a compromise is needed between the boost capability of the battery and the total mission endurance.

                  Optimization design of energy management strategy (EMS) for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), which significantly affects the vehicle performance on fuel economy and pollutant emission, has always been a focal issue. Of various EMSs, rule-based strategies are dominant in practical applications due to their relatively low computational burden, but to obtain the optimum control parameters precisely and efficiently remains an unsolved problem. In this paper, a novel combinatorial algorithm utilizing the historical data from remote monitoring platform is proposed for the EMS optimization of PHEV. Firstly, the historical driving data are processed, and then a table which records different conditions at different time is built for reflecting the future PHEV operation schedule. Based on the historical data, a combinatorial algorithm which combines the advantages of genetic algorithm (GA) with enhanced ant colony algorithm (EACA) is proposed to optimize the control parameters. The principle of algorithm transformation from GA to EACA is when the objective function value is smaller than the default value after five generations of changing continuously in GA optimization process, and then the control parameter combinations can be regarded as the pheromone for EACA. Results show that the combinatorial algorithm successfully overcomes the low solution precision by GA and the slow resolving speed by EACA. The energy consumption of PHEV on a specific bus route can be reduced greatly by the proposed method, and it can provide a theoretical guidance for practical applications.

Pure battery vehicles had emerged a century earlier but did not operate satisfactorily because of high mass, low range, long recharge times, and poor performance at low temperatures. Now there is a competition between pure fuel cell and pure battery vehicles, which can be resolved advantageously by moving to the hydrogen fuel cell-battery hybrid.

Cost is one of the major barriers to the commercialization of fuel cell vehicles, therefore it is important to study how the sizing configuration affects overall vehicle cost. In this paper, degradation models for the fuel cell and the battery on board a fuel cell/battery hybrid bus are incorporated into the power management system to extend their lifetimes. Different sizing configurations were studied and the results reveal that the optimal size with highest lifetime and lowest average cost is highly dependent on the drive cycle. The vehicle equipped with a small fuel cell stack serving as a range extender will fail earlier and consume more fuel under drive cycles with high average power demand resulting in higher overall cost. However, the same configuration gives optimal results under a standard bus cycle with lower average power demand. At the other end of the spectrum, a fuel cell-dominant bus does not guarantee longer lifetime since the fuel cell operates mostly under low-load conditions which correspond to higher potentials reducing lifetime. Such a configuration also incurs a higher initial capital cost of the fuel cell stack resulting in a high average cost. The best configuration is a battery-dominated system with moderately-sized fuel cell stack which achieves the longest lifetime combined with the lowest average running cost throughout the lifetime of the vehicle.

                  Series-parallel hybrid electric vehicle (SPHEV) is a compact and effective configuration of HEV, which has great potential to save fuel consumption. Because of multi power sources (one engine and two electric motors) and various driving conditions, it is difficult to design an optimal energy management strategy (EMS). To obtain better fuel economy, a novel particle swarm optimization based (PSO-based) nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) strategy is proposed for EMS of SPHEV. First, a nonlinear model predictive control framework is designed. Then, a modified particle swarm optimization is used for receding horizon optimization.

               ","(SPHEV) is a compact and effective configuration of HEV, which has great potential to save fuel consumption. Because of multi power sources (one engine and two electric motors) and various driving conditions, it is difficult to design an optimal energy management strategy (EMS). To obtain better fuel economy, a novel particle swarm optimization based (PSO-based) nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) strategy is proposed for EMS of SPHEV.

                  Conventional internal combustion engines exhibit efficiency in the range of 30%–40%. A significant portion of the remaining energy is dissipated as exhaust heat, some of which can be recovered using thermoelectric generators to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The current study evaluates the benefits of using thermoelectric electric generators in hybrid electric vehicles over a prescribed drive-cycle. Specifically, a hybrid electric bus was first modeled over a realistic urban drive-cycle. Engine operating parameters such as torque and speed were extracted and provided as inputs to an engine simulation model. A virtual thermoelectric generator was then modeled using the Matlab/Simulink architecture to evaluate the quantity of energy that can be recovered based on inputs from the engine simulation model. Simulations were carried out to accurately assess the amount of fuel savings achieved due to the use of the thermoelectric generators system. From the analysis, it was observed that a fuel saving of 7.2% and 6.5% can be achieved with the use of Skutterudite and Silicon Germanium-based thermoelectric generator systems, respectively. It was also observed that the additional weight of the thermoelectric generator system had a negligible effect on the fuel consumption.

                  Optimization of fuel cell/battery hybrid vehicle systems has primarily focused on reducing fuel consumption. However, it is also necessary to focus on fuel cell and battery durability as inadequate lifespan is still a major barrier to the commercialization of fuel cell vehicles. Here, we introduce a power management strategy which concurrently accounts for fuel consumption as well as fuel cell and battery degradation. Fuel cell degradation is quantified using a simplified electrochemical model which provides an analytical solution for the decay of the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) in the fuel cell by accounting for the performance loss due to transient power load, start/stop cycles, idling and high power load. The results show that the performance loss based on remaining ECSA matches well with test data in the literature. A validated empirical model is used to relate Lithium-ion battery capacity decay to C-rate. Simulations are then conducted using a typical bus drive cycle to optimize the fuel cell/battery hybrid system. We demonstrate that including these degradation models in the objective function can effectively extend the lifetime of the fuel cell at the expense of higher battery capacity decay resulting in a lower average running cost over the lifetime of the vehicle.

Three equivalent circuit models are considered to simulate the battery electrical performance: linear static, non-linear static and non-linear with first-order dynamics. When dimensioning a battery-based vehicle, less complex models may lead to a solution with more battery cells and higher costs. Despite the same tendency, when a hybrid vehicle is taken into account, the influence of the battery models is dependent on the sizing strategy. In this work, two sizing strategies are evaluated: dynamic programming and filter-based. For the latter, the complexity of the battery model has a clear influence on the result of the sizing problem. On the other hand, a modest influence is observed when a dynamic programming strategy is followed.

First, DP is used to extract the boundary of mode switching and shift schedule under three typical driving cycles in offline, especially, RE is corrected using the boundary of mode switching. Second, an instantaneous optimization strategy-ECMS is used to replace the Charge-Depleting Mode (CD) of RE for finding the real-time optimal solution in a wider range in online, in this part, owe to the fixed distance of urban public transport, a reference State of Charge (SOC) is formulated, and the Proportion-Integration (PI) algorithm is used to make the actual SOC always follow the reference SOC by adjusting the equivalent factor. Finally, combine all the above efforts, a real-time optimization EMS is proposed and validated through simulation and experiment. The results show that this approach can significantly enhance the vehicle drivability, with overall obvious improvement of the comprehensive performance qualification based on both fuel economy and drivability.

                  In this paper, an energy management method is proposed for a power-split plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). Through analyzing the PHEV powertrain, a series of quadratic equations are employed to approximate the vehicle's fuel-rate, using battery current as the input. Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) is introduced to find the battery current commands by solving the Hamiltonian function. Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm is applied to calculate the engine-on power and the maximum current coefficient.

                  Advanced hybrid powerplants combining a fuel cell and battery can enable significantly higher endurance for small, electrically powered unmanned aircraft systems, compared with batteries alone. However, detailed investigations of the static and dynamic performance of such systems are required to address integration challenges. This article describes a series of tests used to characterise the Horizon Energy Systems' AeroStack hybrid, fuel-cell-based powertrain. The results demonstrate that a significant difference can exist between the dynamic performance of the fuel-cell system and its static polarisation curve, confirming the need for detailed measurements. The results also confirm that the AeroStack's lithium-polymer battery plays a crucial role in its response to dynamic load changes and protects the fuel cell from membrane dehydration and fuel starvation. At low static loads, the AeroStack fuel cell recharges the battery with currents up to 1 A, which leads to further differences with the polarisation curve.

The method is based on the analysis of an existing optimal control law, which can be obtained using Dynamic Programming, by means of the local partial derivatives. This permits to obtain a set of upper and lower bounds for instantaneous value of the time-varying Lagrange multiplier of the constrained optimization problem, which can be represented in so-called Λ-plots. From that plots, it is possible to provide an estimate of the optimal parameters for tuning energy management control strategies as the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy and Pontryagin Minimum Principle. Λ-plots also provide a good framework for analysing the equivalence of different control strategies. The Λ-plot method is demonstrated for both series and parallel configurations of a hybrid electrical vehicle.

                  To improve the energy efficiency of hybrid electric city buses, a hierarchical predictive energy management strategy (HP-EMS) based on driver behavior and type is proposed in this paper. Within the model predictive control (MPC) framework, the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) method is applied to identify the driver type, and the deep neural network (DNN) is adopted to predict future speed based on the historical speed, driver type, and driver behavior. Combined with the city bus driving characteristics, the hierarchical strategy aims to reduce the frequent starts of the engine. The upper-level controller implements a rule-based strategy to limit the engine start-stop frequency. The lower-level controller uses dynamic programming (DP) to search for the best control strategy in the prediction horizon. Simulation results show that, compared with speed prediction without driver information, the new method can effectively improve the accuracy of future speed prediction, and RMSE between the prediction and measurement drops from 1.58 m/s to 1.45 m/s. The HP-EMS without driver information can reduce the number of engine starts by 30% while increase only 2% energy consumption compared with predictive energy management without hierarchical control. The paper also studies the benefits of considering driver behavior and type. The same HP-EMS controller is implemented with and without driver behavior and type. The one with the additional information reduces the energy consumption by 3.34% compared to the one without the information.

                  In order to achieve near-optimal fuel economy for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) using the equivalent consumption minimum strategy (ECMS), it is necessary to dynamically tune the equivalent factor (EF). Unlike widely used model-based approaches, this paper proposes a data-driven ECMS that determines the EF using an artificial neural network (ANN). First, by comparing Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) with the ECMS, one can find that the EF is related to the co-state value of the PMP method. Then, an ANN is constructed with three accessible input variables, including the current demanded power, the ratio of the distance travelled to the total distance, and the battery State of Charge (SOC). The neural network is subsequently trained using real-world speed profiles. Simulations are performed considering different initial SOC values. The results reveal that the proposed data-driven ECMS demonstrates satisfactory fuel economy compared to global optimization methods like dynamic programming and PMP methods. The computational time of the proposed method relative to the duration of the entire trip indicates a great potential for the development of a time-conscious energy management strategy. Moreover, the impact of training sample size on the ANN performance is discussed.

                  This paper presents the modeling and supervisory energy management design of a hybrid fuel cell/battery-powered passenger bus. With growing concerns about petroleum usage and greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector, finding alternative methods for vehicle propulsion is necessary. Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell systems are viable possibilities for energy converters due to their high efficiencies and zero emissions. It has been shown that the benefits of PEM fuel cell systems can be greatly improved through hybridization. In this work, the challenge of developing an on-board energy management strategy with near-optimal performance is addressed by a two-step process. First, an optimal control based on Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) is implemented to find the global optimal solution which minimizes fuel consumption, for different drive cycles, with and without grade. The optimal solutions are analyzed in order to aid in development of a practical controller suitable for on-board implementation, in the form of an Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) regulator. Simulation results show that the ARMA controller is capable of achieving fuel economy within 3% of the PMP controller while being able to limit the transient demand on the fuel cell system.

                  A major advantage of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles is their high fuel economy, which is closely related to their energy management strategy and driving cycles. In this study, an improved velocity prediction method is formulated based on the Markov model and a back propagation neural network. The root mean square error of the predicted velocity for the New European Driving Cycle is 0.1511 m/s when the prediction time is 3 s. Moreover, a vehicle test for the velocity prediction algorithm is implemented on a hybrid electric bus, which verifies the reliability and real-time performance. On this basis, a model predictive control-based energy management strategy incorporating the velocity prediction is proposed. In order to lessen the computation and memory burden and constrain the battery's state of charge, a state of charge-based adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy is applied to the predictive control-based energy management strategy.

                  Intra-city buses have become an effective way to alleviate urban traffic congestion. Developing the driving cycle for an intra-city hybrid electric bus is of great importance for energy economy and emissions performances tests, as well as control strategy optimization to enhance fuel economy and reduce emissions. In the construction of the bus driving cycle using the adapted regular method based on kinematic segments with fixed time-steps, the transition of partial kinematic segments leads to velocity fluctuation, which does not reflect the actual driving characteristics. This study initially collects driving data from a hybrid electric bus in Shanghai, and constructs its typical driving cycle by the k-means clustering method. Considering the characteristics of frequent stopping and repetition during the bus driving cycle, the bus-station-based driving cycle segment division method and the whole-trip-based bus driving cycle construction method are proposed. A typical hybrid electric bus driving cycle is then constructed using the proposed methods. Finally, the typical hybrid electric bus driving cycles developed by two methods are compared and analyzed. The 2-norm value of the characteristic parameter error vector is decreased from 0.249 for the typical hybrid electric bus driving cycle based on the adapted regular method to 0.163 for the improved method. It is shown that the whole-trip-based bus driving cycle construction method reflects the actual driving characteristics better, has lighter computation burden, and lays the foundation for the development of an adaptive control strategy for the hybrid electric bus as well as tests of its energy economy and emissions.

                  Hydraulic-pneumatic hybrid powertrains provide an opportunity for combined high power and high energy regenerative braking systems for heavy duty vehicles that need to transpose both highway and urban areas. The challenge in designing these systems resides in the proper sizing, integration, and control of the components to exploit with high efficiency the different energy and power range available in these applications. In the novel concept proposed here, braking energy is recovered by a hydraulic system and stored in a hydraulic accumulator and in an air reservoir. While the hydraulic system shares the vehicle propulsion in parallel to the internal combustion engine, the compressed air is used to power auxiliaries in power-assist mode. The conception, modeling, sizing, and system integration are presented, relying on commercially available components. The lumped parameter simulation model written in MATLAB/Simulink is first validated by comparing measurements and predictions for a laboratory system. Then, two conditions of braking energy recovery for a 19 tonnes bus are analyzed: a full stop, typical of urban driving, and a downward road slope, typical of highway driving. Results indicate that the system proposed is able to store 69% of the available energy during full stop and 14% in the highway downward slope. However, although the storage efficiency is smaller in the downward slope, the total energy recovered is 2.8 times larger than the energy recovered after full stop. Also, while the pneumatic energy stored is only 20% of the energy stored in the hydraulic accumulators after full stop, it is more than twice for the road slope. These results indicate an opportunity for significantly improving the overall energy efficiency of delivery trucks and buses.

The use of virtual battery models eliminates the need for expensive battery prototypes. Virtual battery properties such as chemistry, state of charge or state of health can be changed instantly. However, the control of a battery emulator is a challenging problem. Very fast reference tracking is required for battery impedance emulation but motor inverters act as constant power loads that have a negative influence on the tracking performance and can even lead to instability. In this paper an MPC strategy is proposed for solving this problem. Scheduling of local controllers is utilized in order to handle the nonlinear and destabilizing load. Furthermore, a fast algorithm is presented that allows real-time MPC subject to input and output constraints. Experimental results obtained with a battery emulator supplying an electric drive inverter demonstrate the performance of the stabilizing controller.

                  As an online adaptive optimization algorithm, the extremum seeking method (ESM) can be effectively employed to find an optimal operating point of a static nonlinear system in real-time. This paper presents a comparative study of different ESM schemes for online energy management strategy of fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FCHEVs). By applying the extremum seeking controller, the fuel cell system operating points can be maintained in a high efficiency region and thus saving the hydrogen consumption. In addition, battery state of charge (SOC) is considered as the input of penalty function for extremum seeking controller, in order to prevent over-discharging/over-charging of the lithium-ion battery during the FCHEVs operation. Different schemes of ESM presented in this comparative study consist of first-order ESM, high-pass filter based ESM, and band-pass filter based ESC. The main evaluation criteria in this comparative study include the utilization of lithium-ion battery, the fluctuation of fuel cell system output power, the fuel cell system efficiency and the hydrogen consumption. A Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) platform is used to experimentally validate the presented comparative study. Experimental comparison results show that, the performance of all the presented ES controllers is close to that of offline benchmark dynamic programming. The band-pass filter based ES controller is preferred to improve both the performance and durability of energy storage system (ESS) in FCHEVs, since this controller is found to have a good ability to limit the fuel cell power dynamics.

                  The fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles have received widespread attention in recent years due to their zero-emission and long mileage. However, the durability of the fuel cell declines rapidly under frequent start and stop and power fluctuation. The fuel efficiency of the power system is affected by the power allocation strategy. For low hydrogen consumption and fuel cell durability, an energy management strategy based on the game theory is proposed in this paper, which considers the controller and the future driving condition as both sides of the game to enhance the operational stability in complex driving conditions. The interval forecast for driving conditions is realized by introducing the Markov chain method. To obtain the optimal power allocation strategy in the speed forecast window, it is reasonable to integrate the co-evolutionary algorithm with the game model to leverage its superior ability in solving the constrained min-max problem. In order to verify the robustness and the economic performance of this method, the comparison with other methods is conducted in the typical urban, highway and mixed driving conditions. What is more, the fuel cell degradation and operational stability of four energy management strategies are evaluated by the fuel cell degradation model. The results show that the proposed method can reduce hydrogen consumption by more than 6.82% and avoid fuel cell degradation caused by frequent start and stop and power fluctuation compared with other real-time strategies.

                  This paper presents a performance analysis of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) considering battery preheating economy under low temperature conditions. In subzero temperature environments, PHEVs suffer a dramatic loss of all-electric driving range due to the energy and power reduction of LiFePO4 batteries, as well as severe battery degradation due to lithium ion plating. This decreases the battery life time and thus increases the operating cost of the PHEV. A quasi-static model is adopted for the simulated bus, and a battery dynamic degradation model is established based on the Arrhenius degradation theory. The PHEV performance under low-temperature conditions is evaluated considering three factors: fuel cost, electricity cost, and battery degradation cost. In addition, the economics of battery preheating powered by the engine or grid is first investigated in this paper. The charge depleting-charge sustaining energy management strategy and convective heating method are adopted. Simulation results show that the preheating strategy can reduce the PHEV operating cost by up to 22.3% in 40 Harbin driving cycles. The heating process becomes increasingly necessary as the battery price, heating efficiency, and daily recharging time of the PHEV increase as well as the environment temperature decreases.

In this paper, a real time capable model predictive control concept is proposed that considers nonlinearities of the electrical system and complies with the constraints of the system. Additionally, novel data based methodologies to predict the future load demand are introduced.

                  Light electric vehicles are a viable way of reducing urban congestion and local pollutant emissions. Electric bicycles combine electrical and human power, hence they represent an appealing class of hybrid vehicles in such a context. Differently from other hybrid vehicles, the energy management of hybrid bicycles is little investigated in the literature. In this work, we study the problem for a series electric-human-powered hybrid architecture, in which there is no direct mechanical link between the pedals and the wheel. We tackle the problem using optimal control principles, aiming to minimize the perceived physical exertion while guaranteeing a predetermined electric range. We build on an approximated solution of the problem and propose a control system that copes with incomplete trip information. In a series of simulation and experimental tests, the proposed strategy approaches the acausal optimum and significantly improves performance if compared to a baseline causal policy; the discussion also encompasses the sensitivity of the results to the requested information.

In a series of simulation and experimental tests, the proposed strategy approaches the acausal optimum and significantly improves performance if compared to a baseline causal policy; the discussion also encompasses the sensitivity of the results to the requested information.

                  Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) can contribute to sustainable transport. Yet, their real-world energy efficiency depends on HEV drivers' eco-driving behaviour. Eco-driving knowledge is key for successful eco-driving. The present research focused on the role of perceived strategy knowledge (know-how) versus technical system knowledge (know-why) in a study with 121 HEV drivers. The relationship between knowledge components and knowledge acquisition processes, as well as fuel efficiency, were examined. Structural equation modelling results indicated that perceived strategy knowledge was related to acquisition by testing (i.e., interacting with the vehicle and its interfaces) and reading (i.e., manuals, books and websites) while technical system knowledge was only related to acquisition by reading. In contrast to technical system knowledge, perceived strategy knowledge was no significant predictor of fuel efficiency. The results indicated that emphasis should be put into promoting technical system knowledge (e.g., by tutoring systems) to support motivated drivers' in achieving higher fuel efficiency.

                  In order to enhance energy efficiency and improve system performance, the road mobility system requires more preview information and advanced methods. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical optimal energy management strategy for electric buses with a battery/ultracapacitor hybrid energy storage system, to optimal split the power and reduce the battery life degradation. This method is based on vehicle-to-cloud connectivity. In the cloud platform, an optimal energy management strategy is developed using dynamic programming, where the battery degradation cost and the electric cost are taken into consideration. In the vehicle level, a model predictive control is developed to deal with the uncertainties, reduce the energy losses, and handle the system constraints. The cost function of the model predictive control includes the ultracapacitor state of charge planning and energy losses. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, a rule-based energy management strategy is developed as the baseline approach. The China bus driving cycle and other six real bus driving cycles recorded in China are used to validate the robustness of the proposed method. To be more realistic, the random uncertainties up to 20% are included in all driving cycles. Furthermore, the time delay and packet losses in communication are also considered. Simulation results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the rule-based method, and the average improvement could be over 40% in the studied driving cycles.

                  A trip-oriented stochastic optimal energy management strategy for plug-in hybrid electric bus is presented in this paper, which includes the offline stochastic dynamic programming part and the online implementation part performed by equivalent consumption minimization strategy. In the offline part, historical driving cycles of the fixed route are divided into segments according to the position of bus stops, and then a segment-based stochastic driving condition model based on Markov chain is built. With the segment-based stochastic model obtained, the control set for real-time implemented equivalent consumption minimization strategy can be achieved by solving the offline stochastic dynamic programming problem. Results of stochastic dynamic programming are converted into a 3-dimensional lookup table of parameters for online implemented equivalent consumption minimization strategy. The proposed strategy is verified by both simulation and hardware-in-loop test of real-world driving cycle on an urban bus route. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms both the well-tuned equivalent consumption minimization strategy and the rule-based strategy in terms of fuel economy, and even proved to be close to the optimal result obtained by dynamic programming. Furthermore, the practical application potential of the proposed control method was proved by hardware-in-loop test.

We estimate a multinomial, a mixed and two hybrid mixed logit models, with the interaction between EC knowledge, car attributes and additional exogenous covariates. We use three measurement equations to estimate the self-assessed car knowledge, assessed EC knowledge and EC driving experience. We report three main findings. First, the inclusion of EC knowledge improves our capability to explain car choice. Second, the degree of EC knowledge does not change the negative perception respondents have, ceteris paribus, on ECs. Third, the level of EC knowledge influences the importance placed on the attributes of the choice model. Specifically, a higher level of EC knowledge is associated with a lower concern with fast charging station density. Our results are useful for car manufacturers who wish to improve their marketing strategies through tailored advertising efforts, and for policy makers who wish to implement educational campaigns as a means to foster EC uptake.

                  Hybrid electric vehicles and in particular micro-hybrids are a short term promising field of research which allows reducing CO2 emissions without any fundamental change in the architecture of the vehicles. They provide fuel saving in urban driving situations thanks to engine cut-off when the car is stopped. Moreover, the use of micro hybrid functionalities also when the engine is running may increase performances once more. In this prospect, the classical optimal control formulation will be extended to the case of micro-hybrids and solutions for the real-time control problem will be derived through a MPC scheme.

                  Increased driving range and enhanced fast charging capabilities are two immediate goals of transport electrification. However, these are of competing nature, leading to increased energy and power demand respectively from the on-board battery pack. By fine-tuning the number of layers versus active electrode material of a lithium ion pouch cell, tailored designs targeting either of these goals can be obtained. Achieving this trade-off through iterative empirical testing of layer choices is expensive and often produces sub-optimal designs. This paper presents a model-based methodology for determining the optimal number of layers, maximising usable energy whilst satisfying specific acceleration and fast charging targets. The proposed methodology accounts for the critical need to avoid lithium plating during fast charging and searches for the optimal layer configuration considering a range of thermal conditions. A numerical implementation of a cell model using a hybrid finite volume-spectral scheme is presented, wherein the model equations are suitably reformulated to directly accept power inputs, facilitating rapid and accurate searching of the layer design space. Electrode materials exhibiting high solid phase diffusion rates are highlighted as being equally as important for extended range as the development of new materials with higher inherent capacity. The proposed methodology is demonstrated for the common module design of a battery pack in a plug-in hybrid vehicle, thereby illustrating how the cost of derivative vehicle models can be reduced. To facilitate model based layer optimisation, the open-source toolbox, BOLD (Battery Optimal Layer Design) is provided.

                  Hybrid electric vehicle technologies emerge mainly because of the instability in fossil fuel prices, resources and the terrible impact of global warming. As most transport systems use fossil fuel and emit greenhouse gases, many researchers have studied the potential of fuel-cell hybrid electric vehicles (FCHEVs). FCHEVs are vehicles with zero greenhouse gas emission because they only depend on hydrogen. Numerous studies have proven that fuel cells with energy storage elements can provide sufficient energy required by FCHEVs. However, end users demand FCHEVs that are not only efficient in delivering the energy required but can also optimize hydrogen consumption and prolong battery lifetime to compete with current internal combustion engine vehicles. Therefore, advanced optimization algorithms for an FCHEV energy management system (EMS) must be developed to improve the performance efficiency of FCHEVs. This paper presents a critical review of the different types of FCHEV EMSs and their optimization algorithms to solve existing limitations and enhance the performance of future FCHEVs. Consequently, a comprehensive review on the major categories of FCHEV EMSs, such as proportional–integral–derivative controller, operational or state mode, rule-based or fuzzy logic, and equivalent consumption minimization strategies, are explained. This paper also describes optimization techniques such as linear programming, dynamic programming, Pontryagin’s minimum principle, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization and rule-based logic optimization for the EMSs of FCHEVs. Furthermore, it focuses on the various factors and challenges of existing optimization algorithms, hydrogen fuel source, environment and safety, and economical and societal concerns, as well as provides recommendations for designing capable and efficient EMSs for FCHEVs. All the highlighted insights of this review will hopefully lead to increasing efforts toward the development of an advanced optimization algorithm for future FCHEV EMSs.

                  Despite their low average efficiency with respect to the mechanical transmissions, the hydromechanical transmissions allow to release the engine speed by the vehicle speed, and to open the possibility for the optimal control of the engine. It follows that the performance and emissions of the powertrain is heavily affected by the logic control.
                  The aim of the paper is to investigate the emission reductions that can be obtained using a Power-Split transmission.
                  Therefore, a hydromechanical transmission has been sized and tested on a 12-ton-city bus by using a one-dimensional model developed in an AMESim environment. Four different control strategies of the powertrain were applied to the model. The CUEDC-ME standard cycle for the characterization of emissions in heavy vehicles was used as a reference mission.
                  The simulation results showed that the hydromechanical transmission reduces consumption or the emission levels with respect to the traditional transmission when managed according to appropriate control strategies. By means of emission values normalized with respect to the standard limits, it is possible to identify a control strategy that allows the reduction of emissions in every usage condition of the vehicle at the expense of a slight increase of consumption.
                  The suggested procedure could help the manufacturer to satisfy the emission standard requirements.

                  Several attempts have been made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) employing hybridization. Compressed air-electrical hybrid system is a promising technology which can be used to reduce the environmental impact of the automotive industry. In cities and urban areas, vehicle’s kinetic energy through braking can be converted to pressurized air which can be stored in a storage tank for reuse to operate the vehicle during starting, cruising, and acceleration. In this study, an efficient expander and compressor are developed using a Wankel device for the compressed air-electric hybrid vehicle. Volumetric Wankel rotary expander and compressor are essential devices for power generation in compressed air energy storage (CAES) system and compressed air hybrid engine powered by the braking energy system leading to a significant decrease in GHG emissions. Compared with conventional expanders and compressors, Wankel expander and compressor have significant advantages due to its compactness, lower vibration, noise, and cost. Different parametric studies have been carried out with different vehicle initial speeds (80, 60, 40) km/h and weights (500, 750, 1000) kg, various braking times (2, 3, 5, 7) s, and finally three different tank sizes (20, 35, 50) l using mathematical modelling MATLAB software. The maximum system energy-saving efficiency achieved was around 77% and instantaneous system efficiency of about 85% at an initial vehicle speed of 80 km/h, braking time of 3 s, and vehicle weight of 750 kg and compressed air tank of 35 l.

                  This work studies the minimization of the fuel consumption of a parallel hybrid vehicle over a driving cycle. The considered vehicle is a conventional vehicle equipped with a low cost hybridization system. A single electric machine replaces both the starter and the alternator. Fuel savings result mainly from two functionalities, namely the regenerative braking and the engine stop&start. A dual electrical power source is also used. An ultra-capacitor is combined to a lead-acid battery by means of a DC/DC converter. Under an assumption commonly made in the literature, it is shown that the optimal control problem with the two electrical storage systems can be reformulated as a new problem where a single equivalent electrical buffer is involved. The optimal power split between the electrical and mechanical paths is determined offline using the Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. The converter control is optimized in a second step in such way that some recommendations on the battery usage are met.

                  Optimization of energy management strategy (EMS) for fuel cell/battery/ultracapacitor hybrid electrical vehicle (FCHEV) is primarily aimed on reducing fuel consumption. However, serious power fluctuation has effect on the durability of fuel cell, which still remains one challenging barrier for FCHEVs. In this paper, we propose an optimized frequency decoupling EMS using fuzzy control method to extend fuel cell lifespan and improve fuel economy for FCHEV. In the proposed EMS, fuel cell, battery and ultracapacitor are employed to supply low, middle and high-frequency components of required power, respectively. For accurately adjusting membership functions of proposed fuzzy controllers, genetic algorithm (GA) is adopted to optimize them considering multiple constraints on fuel cell power fluctuation and hydrogen consumption. The proposed EMS is verified by Advisor-Simulink and experiment bench. Simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed EMS can effectively reduce hydrogen consumption in three typical drive cycles, limit fuel cell power fluctuation within 300 W/s and thus extend fuel cell lifespan.

                  An evaluation of currently optimization energy management strategies is done in this study. The load-following – based strategy for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (FC) Hybrid Power Systems ensure the DC power flow balance using the FC system as main energy source. Thus, the battery will operate in charge-sustaining mode. So, the battery state-of-charge will vary in imposed window without need of monitoring the battery. Furthermore, the size and maintenance of the battery stack will decrease compared with rule-based strategies. So for the first time, the classification and evaluation of seven FC Hybrid Power Systems and their possible energy management strategies (including a new one) are performed using the performance indicators related to fuel economy and FC electrical efficiency of the FC system. Consequently, the optimization of the FC Hybrid Power Systems under variable load will mix these performance indicators through the weighting coefficients knet
                      and kfuel

A new switching strategy for the load-following control and real-time optimization loops is proposed to further increase the fuel economy based on the results obtained in this study. The objective of this study is to highlight how optimization function and switching strategy through choosing the weighting coefficients and the control references could improve the fuel economy. Thus, the design of the switching strategy based on available information about the current load demand and the distance to fuel stations is presented in this paper as well. This switching strategy will push hydrogen to become an energy carrier feasible for FC vehicles.

                  Nowadays, there is a great shortage of non-renewable energy, and the environmental problems such as air pollution caused by automobile exhaust are very serious. The traditional fuel vehicle has been unable to meet the current human needs, so more and more people are concerned about the development of the hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Based on proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is a new clean energy without pollution, PEMFC-HEV has a great potential for development. In this review, we have made a comprehensive research on energy management strategy (EMS) of the hybrid power system (HPS) for PEMFC-HEV in recent years. This paper focuses on the EMS of PEMFC as the main power source, the battery and the supercapacitor (SC) as the auxiliary energy in HEV. In this research, the classification of PEMFC-HEV is introduced in detail, and the advantages and disadvantages of various combinations of HPS are summarized. In addition, according to the different requirements and optimization targets of PEMFC-HEV, this paper makes a deep study of the current PEMFC-HEV hybrid system model, and the EMS developed by the researchers. Besides, the simulation and experimental results are compared with each other. From the perspective of strict evaluation, the existing technology can perform more or less. However, high efficiency and optimization performance still fail to achieve high goals. Therefore, the current problems and main control strategies of PEMFC-HEV are discussed and summarized, which is helpful for the development of PEMFC-HEV research in the future. The review will be expected to bring more efforts to the future development of PEMFC-HEV, including faster dynamic response, longer service lifetime, economic optimization, and high efficiency for the PEMFC system.

In this research, the classification of PEMFC-HEV is introduced in detail, and the advantages and disadvantages of various combinations of HPS are summarized. In addition, according to the different requirements and optimization targets of PEMFC-HEV, this paper makes a deep study of the current PEMFC-HEV hybrid system model, and the EMS developed by the researchers. Besides, the simulation and experimental results are compared with each other. From the perspective of strict evaluation, the existing technology can perform more or less. However, high efficiency and optimization performance still fail to achieve high goals. Therefore, the current problems and main control strategies of PEMFC-HEV are discussed and summarized, which is helpful for the development of PEMFC-HEV research in the future. The review will be expected to bring more efforts to the future development of PEMFC-HEV, including faster dynamic response, longer service lifetime, economic optimization, and high efficiency for the PEMFC system.

                  In this article, an optimal vehicle control strategy based on a time-triggered controller area network (TTCAN) system for a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell/nickel-metal hydride (Ni-MH) battery powered city bus is presented. Aiming at improving the fuel economy of the city bus, the control strategy comprises an equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) and a braking energy regeneration strategy (BERS). On the basis of the introduction of a battery equivalent hydrogen consumption model incorporating a charge-sustaining coefficient, an analytical solution to the equivalent consumption minimization problem is given. The proposed strategy has been applied in several city buses for the Beijing Olympic Games of 2008. Results of the “China city bus typical cycle” testing show that, the ECMS and the BERS lowered hydrogen consumption by 2.5% and 15.3% respectively, compared with a rule-based strategy. The BERS contributes much more than the ECMS to the fuel economy, because the fuel cell system does not leave much room for the optimal algorithm in improving the efficiency.

                  In this paper, an adaptive energy management strategy (AEMS) under model predictive control (MPC) framework is proposed. The main advantage of the AEMS is that it fully integrates the economy driving pro system (EDPS), which can provide the renewable energy consumption trajectory considering dynamic traffic information of target driving task, namely the state of charge (SOC) reference constraint for the MPC optimal calculation at each control step. Moreover, based on the dynamically updated traffic information, the SOC reference constraint will be re-planned with correction, which will further reflect the ideal energy consumption trend over the actual driving cycle. For the MPC prediction aspect, the deep neural network (DNN) is applied in this paper to predict the future short-term velocity with 5s, 10s and 15s horizon, respectively. Meanwhile, the dynamic programming (DP) is applied to calculate the optimal energy distribution at each MPC control step. Simulation results show that under the test driving cycle, the optimal MPC predictive horizon with the assistance of EDPS is 10s, and the fuel economy rate can improve up to 6.48% compared with energy management without the assistance of EDPS. Moreover, the HIL test indicates the AEMS has well real-time performance as well.

                  An efficient energy split among different source of energy has been a challenge for existing hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) supervisory control system. It requires an optimized energy use of internal combustion engine and electric source such as battery, fuel cell, ultracapacitor, etc. In recent years,Reinforcement Learning (RL) based energy management strategy (EMS) has emerged as one of theefficient control strategies. The effectivenessReinforcement Learningmethod largely depends on optimized parameter selections.However, a thorough parametric study still lacks in this field. It is a fundamental step for efficient implementation of the RL-based EMS. Different from existing RL-based EMS literature, this study conducts a parametric study on several key factors during the RL-based EMS development, including: (1) state types and number of states, (2) states and action discretization, (3) exploration and exploitation, and (4) learning experience selection. The main results show that learning experience selection can effectively reduce the vehicle fuel consumption. The study of the states and action discretization show that the vehicle fuel consumption reduces as action discretization increases while increasing the states discretization is detrimental to the fuel consumption. Moreover, the increasing number of states improves fuel economy. With the help of the proposed parametric analysis, the RL-based EMS can be easily adapted to other power split problems in a HEV application.

                  Energy storage systems (ESSs) play an important role in the performance and economy of electrified vehicles. Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) combining both lithium-ion cells and supercapacitors is one of the most promising solutions. This paper discusses the optimal HESS dimensioning and energy management of a fuel cell hybrid electric bus. Three novel contributions are added to the relevant literature. First, efficient convex programming is used to simultaneously optimize the HESS dimension (including sizes of both the lithium-ion battery pack and the supercapacitor stack) and the power allocation between the HESS and the fuel cell system (FCS) of the hybrid bus. In the combined plant/controller optimization problem, a dynamic battery State-of-Health (SOH) model is integrated to quantitatively examine the impact of the battery replacement strategy on both the HESS size and the bus economy. Second, the HESS and the battery-only ESS options are systematically compared in the proposed optimization framework. Finally, the battery-health-perceptive HESS optimization outcome is contrasted to the ideal one neglecting the battery degradation (assuming that the battery is durable over the bus service period without deliberate power regulation).

Then, control strategy based on fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is developed for various driving conditions which their membership function (MF) parameters and rules are tuned by employing genetic algorithm (GA). In the next step, by recognition and prediction of upcoming traffic condition, control strategy is switched between optimized FLCs to enhance the optimal power split between sources and manage the internal combustion engine (ICE) to work in the vicinity of its optimal condition. Finally, the effects of control strategy, mass and aerodynamic parameters on PHEV performance and energy usage of components are investigated.

The proposed sizing methodology is based on the fulfilment of power requirements, including sustained speed tests and stochastic driving cycles. The procedure to generate driving cycles is also presented in this paper. The sizing algorithm explicitly accounts for the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS). The performance is compared with optimal consumption, which is found using an off-line strategy via Dynamic Programming. The sizing methodology provides guidance for sizing the fuel cell and the supercapacitor number. The results also include analysis on oversizing the fuel cell and varying the parameters of the energy management strategy. The simulation results highlight the importance of integrating sizing and energy management into fuel cell hybrid vehicles.

                  In this paper we introduce a class of continuous-time hybrid dynamical systems called integral continuous-time hybrid automata (icHA) for which we propose an event-driven optimization-based control strategy. Events include both external actions applied to the system and changes of continuous dynamics (mode switches). The icHA formalism subsumes a number of hybrid dynamical systems with practical interest, e.g., linear hybrid automata. Different cost functions, including minimum-time and minimum-effort criteria, and constraints are examined in the event-driven optimal control formulation. This is translated into a finite-dimensional mixed-integer optimization problem, in which the event instants and the corresponding values of the control input are the optimization variables. As a consequence, the proposed approach has the advantage of automatically adjusting the attention of the controller to the frequency of event occurrence in the hybrid process. A receding horizon control scheme exploiting the event-based optimal control formulation is proposed as a feedback control strategy and proved to ensure either finite-time or asymptotic convergence of the closed-loop.

                  In recent years, design optimization of hybrid power generation systems which utilize renewable energy resources has received a significant attention. One of the most challenging problems in design of such systems is optimal sizing. To tackle this drawback, this paper presents an efficient and robust optimization approach for size optimization of a hybrid system composed of photovoltaic (PV) panel, diesel generator and fuel cell (FC). The proposed method is a modified version of crow search algorithm (CSA) in which awareness probability is adjusted by an adaptive manner. In the sizing framework, total net present cost (TNPC) is minimized subject to two main constraints: loss of power supply probability (LPSP) and renewable energy portion (REP). Simulation results show that (1) REP has a considerable impact on TNPC of the designed system, (2) optimal combination of PV, diesel generator, FC, electrolyzer and hydrogen tank leads to establishing a reliable and cost-effective hybrid power generation system and (3) the proposed method (CSAadaptive-AP) finds more promising and robust results than original CSA, genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO).

                  The control of PHEVs (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles) strictly depends on the management of the battery SOC (State of Charge) over a given trip. Indeed this key vehicle parameter affects the vehicle autonomy and its evolution may be enhanced by a proper match with further “external” variables, such as the availability of recharge stations and their characteristic speed for battery recharging.
                  In this paper we propose an easily implementable control strategy, that is intrinsically robust with respect to the variation of used SOC over a trip and is based only on a preliminary knowledge of the target distance. Its use is experimentally demonstrated on a prototype PHEV to accomplish a defined target SOC at the end of the trip. A vehicle model has also been validated, in comparison with previously gathered experimental data, and then applied to analyze the control strategy behavior by varying input data such as trip distance, speed over time and target SOC. Results show that the target SOC may be obtained within an error in the range of 2%, allowing for a potential fuel economy increase up to 8.2% if compared with a baseline PHEV strategy. However fuel economy increase definitely depends on key trip characteristics such as speed profile, duration, distance, etc.

                  Hybrid storage systems consisting of battery and ultra-capacitor have recently emerged as an alternative to the conventional single buffer layout in hybrid vehicles. Their high power and energy density could improve the performance indices of the vehicle, provided that an optimal energy management strategy is employed that could handle systems with multiple degrees of freedom (DOF). The majority of existing energy management strategies is limited to a single DOF and the small body of work on multi-DOF systems is mainly heuristic-based.

An efficient MDDP code is developed using MATLAB™'s vectorization feature that helps reduce the inherently high computational cost of MDDP. Results of multiple simulated experiments are presented to demonstrate the applicability and performance of the proposed strategy. A comparison is also made between a single and a double buffer fuel-cell hybrid vehicle in various driving cycles to determine the maximum reduction in fuel consumption that can be achieved by the addition of an ultra-capacitor.

                  Power management strategy of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle for real-time application is a major challenge as the driving pattern is unknown beforehand. In this work, an innovative real-time power management strategy framework is proposed, including short horizon driving pattern prediction, driving pattern recognition, parameter off-line optimisation, parameter on-line prediction modelling, and power management strategy real-time application. A group of characteristic parameters is used to recognise driving patterns and the engine and motor working points are optimised globally by distributed genetic algorithm off-line. The optimised results approximation model is built on the basis of a radial basis function-neural network. Based on a linear programming algorithm, the higher order Markov velocity predictor is designed to obtain the short-horizon driving conditions. Combining the optimisation results approximation model, the real-time power management strategy is proposed. The on-line optimisation power management strategy comparing to the rule-based is analysed and the MATLAB/Simulink/AVL Cruise co-simulation results demonstrate that the fuel economy of real-time power management strategy improved by 16.3%, 12.7%, and 9.1% in HWFET, LA92, and Japanese urban driving patterns, respectively, which is largely higher than with a traditional rule-based strategy and slightly lower than, or approximately equal to, the global optimisation strategy.

The management strategy of the hybrid propulsion system is a significant technique for the vehicular power system. In this work, a finite state machine based management strategy is first proposed for both the battery/fuel cell and battery/supercapacitor/fuel cell system. The power capabilities of the battery and supercapacitor have been considered as important parameters in the management strategy. Moreover, an optimal oxygen excess ratio control is presented to maximize the fuel cell output net power.

The experimental and simulated results indicate that the proposed method is able to guarantee the required power during most of the driving cycles.

Service vehicles (e.g. delivery trucks or public buses) generally have predetermined routes, thus it is feasible and profitable to utilize a model predictive control strategy to improve the fuel economy of the new powertrain. However, the mass/load of such service vehicles is time-varying during a drive cycle. Therefore, an adaptive model predictive controller should be designed to account for this variation. Although the drive cycle is preset, it would experience uncertainties or disturbances caused by traffic or weather conditions in real situations. To deal with this problem, a large step size prediction method is used in the adaptive model predictive algorithm to enhance its robustness. The proposed algorithm is compared to a prescient model predictive controller in different scenarios to demonstrate its applicability and optimality (more than 7% fuel savings). The proposed approach is independent of the powertrain topology such that it is able to be directly extended to other types of hybrid electric vehicles.

                  This paper evaluates the option of using a new powertrain based on fuel cell (FC), battery and supercapacitor (SC) for the Urbos 3 tramway in Zaragoza, Spain. In the proposed powertrain configuration, a hydrogen Proton-Exchange-Membrane (PEM) FC acts as main energy source, and a Li-ion battery and a SC as energy support and storage systems. The battery supports the FC during the starting and accelerations, and furthermore, it absorbs the power generated during the regenerative braking. Otherwise, the SC, which presents the fastest dynamic response, acts mainly during power peaks, which are beyond the operating range of the FC and battery. The FC, battery and SC use a DC/DC converter to connect each energy source to the DC bus and to control the energy exchange. This configuration would allow the tramway to operate in an autonomous way without grid connection. The components of the hybrid tramway, selected from commercially available devices have been modeled in MATLAB-Simulink. The energy management system used for controlling the components of the new hybrid system allows optimizing the fuel consumption (hydrogen) by applying an equivalent consumption minimization strategy. This control system is evaluated by simulations for the real driving cycle of the tramway. The results show that the proposed control system is valid for its application to this hybrid system.

                  The aim of this paper is to present an on-line adaptive equivalent consumption minimum strategy (AECMS) for fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle powered by fuel cell, battery and supercapacitor. In order to design the AECMS, an equivalent consumption minimum strategy (ECMS) without considering power sources degradation is firstly designed to decrease hydrogen consumption and degradation of power sources, which chooses fuel cell as the main power source to supply steady power, battery as the main energy storage source to buffer energy demand by vehicle and supercapacitor as the peak power supplier. A testbench is built to validate the developed ECMS. By contrastive experimental tests on ECMS, Rule Based Control Strategy (RBCS) and a Hybrid ECMS Operating mode control Strategy (HEOS) through the built test bench, hydrogen consumption of ECMS decreases 2.16% and 1.47% respectively and it also has the smoothest fuel cell current. Along with the degradation of fuel cell and battery, the charge sustenance objective of battery cannot be reached. Therefore, AECMS is finally designed to adjust equivalent factors and fuel cell dynamic current change rate along with the state of health (SOH) of fuel cell and battery, to make sure the charge sustenance of battery and prolong the lifetime of fuel cell. The method that on-line estimates their SOHs and the effects of their degradation on ECMS are also analyzed.

                  Power split configurations exhibit potential on decreasing fuel consumption. However, how to select the best power split configuration among all the possible configurations still need to be explored. In this paper, a one-dimensional searching ECMS (Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy) is developed to evaluate fuel consumption for input power split configuration. Additionally, a battery degradation model based on experimental data is applied to evaluate the battery degradation for input power split configuration. According to one-dimensional searching ECMS and battery degradation model, the impact of different input power split configurations on fuel consumption and battery degradation is investigated. Simulations show that configuration T1 has fuel consumption and battery degradation advantages for PHEV city bus application in China. These advantages are observed because the system efficiency operation points of configuration T1 are closer to the high efficiency area than the system efficiency operation points of other input power split configurations. Furthermore, according to the lever model and one-dimensional searching ECMS method, a power split configuration selection method is provided in this paper. The simulation results based on configuration selection method still indicate that configuration T1 appears to have the best fuel economy for PHEV city bus application. Moreover, configuration T5, with a lever length close to 0, exhibits the worst fuel consumption and battery degradation.

                  Fuel cell plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (FC-PHEVs) can have extended range while utilizing cheap grid electricity, but has poor durability of onboard fuel cells due to dynamic loading. In this study, fuel cell durability is enhanced significantly for a novel configuration of FC-PHEVs with three fuel cell stacks through strategic power management by making each fuel cell stack work only at a fixed operating point (i.e., constant output power) and by shortening its active time (operation) via on-off switching control. A hysteresis control strategy of power management is designed to make the active time evenly distributed over the three fuel cell stacks and to reduce the number of on-off switching. The results indicate that the durability of the onboard fuel cells can be increased 11.8, 4.8 and 6.9 times, respectively, for an urban, highway and a combined urban-highway driving cycle. This enhanced fuel cell durability is derived from the fact that the average power demand of real-time driving cycles is only a fraction of the maximum power that FC-PHEVs could provide, and substantially increased durability can be used to reduce the over-design, hence the cost, of fuel cells.

This enhanced fuel cell durability is derived from the fact that the average power demand of real-time driving cycles is only a fraction of the maximum power that FC-PHEVs could provide, and substantially increased durability can be used to reduce the over-design, hence the cost, of fuel cells.

                  This paper presents a novel predictive control scheme for energy management in hybrid trucks that drive autonomously on the highway. The proposed scheme uses information from GPS together with information about the speed limits along the planned route to schedule the charging and discharging of the battery, the vehicle speed, the gear, and when to turn off the engine and drive electrically. The proposed control scheme divides the predictive control problem into three layers that operate with different update frequencies and prediction horizons. The top layer plans the kinetic and electric energy in a convex optimization problem. In order to avoid a mixed-integer problem, the gear and the switching decision between hybrid and pure electric mode are optimized in a lower layer in a dynamic program whereas the lowest control layer only reacts on the current state and available references. The benefits of the proposed predictive control scheme are shown by simulations between Frankfurt and Koblenz. The simulations show that the predictive control scheme is able to significantly reduce the mechanical braking, resulting in fuel reductions of 4% when allowing an over and under speed of 5km/h.

                  The energy crisis and exhaust emissions are serious problems that are largely related to road traffic. One solution to these threats is to switch from traditional gasoline-based vehicles to hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) or electric vehicles (EVs), which also has the benefit of promoting a more sustainable economy. Energy management strategies (EMS) for HEVs or EVs play an important role in improving fuel economy. As a stochastic prediction method, a Markov chain, has been widely used in the prediction of driving conditions, but the application of a Markov chain in the prediction of HEV-operating modes in a rule-based EMS has rarely been presented in the literature. In addition, the threshold selection of rule-based EMS is usually based on experience and it is difficult to achieve optimal performance. In this paper, the impact of operation-mode prediction on rule-based EMS fuel economy has been explored to achieve real-time on-line corrections to motor and engine torque and to enhance their capacity for on-line optimization. Thus, a new EMS for HEV has been proposed based on operation-mode prediction using a Markov chain, which determines the on-line correction of torque distribution between the engine and the electric motor. The Markov decision processes and transition matrix are introduced first, and then, the transition probability matrix and torque correction model are established using the MATLAB/Simulink platform. The results of the simulation show that the proposed approach provides a 13.1% and 9.6% improvement in real fuel consumption under the New European Driving Cycle and the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule respectively, in comparison with the conventional rule-based control strategies without operation-mode prediction. The results also show that the proposed control strategy can significantly enhance the real-time optimization control performance of the EMS while maintaining the state of charge within a reasonable range.

                  This article presents analysis of the systems in a Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) prototype with the aim of determining if it is possible to increase vehicle efficiency through strategic control of the auxiliary systems. To accomplish this, an overview of the vehicle design is given as well as an in depth analysis of the powertrain efficiency and control strategy. This leads to the development of a modified powertrain control algorithm which also oversees and controls the auxiliary power demand in real-time. The auxiliary control aspect of this algorithm follows predefined rules as determined through analysis of the individual systems, and based on the definitions of flexible useful and wasteful auxiliary power. The simulation results show that the proposed technique, applied to FCEV air conditioning system alone, improves the fuel economy in the neighborhood of 3.4% compared to conventional bang-bang controller. This magnitude of energy reduction is very significant in the automotive industry, especially when considering the number of vehicles in use in today's transportation sector. The resulting algorithm is adaptable to a number of different types of auxiliary systems and primary power sources, thereby not specifically tied to the fuel cell architecture for which it is developed.

                  In Asia, two wheelers are popular mode of transportation to a large group of people because of their relative affordability and ability to maneuver in heavy city traffic. However, the rate of fuel consumption and emission contribution by them, especially in urban areas need more attention to improve sustainability of energy and air quality. Recently, plug-in hybrid technology has been emerged as one of the most promising alternatives in reducing petroleum consumption and emission. This paper presents the implementation of plug-in hybrid technology on a two wheeler by formulation of novel control strategy suitable for Indian city driving needs. Experimental investigations on hub motor and IC (internal combustion) engine has been carried out to fix the change-over speed in hybrid mode, followed by road test on prototype vehicle. The performance of prototype vehicle on IDC (Indian driving cycle) simulated road pattern and actual road driving, confirmed the change-over speed of vehicle in hybrid mode. The converted plug-in hybrid electric two wheeler also demonstrated the drive strategy adopted for higher energy efficiency up to 2.5 times. So, plug-in hybrid electric two wheelers show significant improvements in fuel economy by replacing petroleum fuel with electricity for portions of trip to achieve nations' energy security.

                  Battery versus hybrid power sources performance is examined in the manuscript. Passive, semi-active and fully active battery–ultracapacitor hybrids show obvious superiority over battery only powered pulsed current loads. Passive hybrid is the most simple and cheap arrangement, however its uncontrolled nature results in several drawbacks during the operation.

                  The transmission system together with power management will simultaneously affect the fuel economy of the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) with automated mechanical transmission (AMT). This paper strives to make three contributions to realize systematic design and optimization of the transmission and power management. Firstly, a design of experiment method is proposed to redesign the current transmission system of the PHEV with Optimal Latin Hypercube Design algorithm. Then, a co-optimization method is proposed to insight into the preferable speed ratios of the redesigned transmission system with multi-island genetic and dynamic programming algorithms. Finally, a Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle-based self-identification controller is proposed to realize adaptive power management control, based on a significant finding that the constant solution of the co-state from off-line iteration optimization can be approximately identified by the mean value of the co-state with time-moving in the self-identification controller. Results demonstrate that the current 6-speed ratio AMT can be reduced to 4, the fuel economy of the redesigned transmission system can be improved by 2.9% compared to the current transmission system and the self-identification controller can further improve the fuel economy of the PHEV compared to the conventional PI controller.

                  This paper aims at presenting the designing, prototyping and testing results of a permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance machine, suited for A/B-segment electric vehicles. The machine is designed to avoid the use of rare-earths materials in the magnets, compensating the loss of performance from adopting ferrite magnets with a novel hairpin winding for the stator and a lightweight modular design for the rotor. Beyond the motor itself, the paper presents the design of the full drive, with an integrated power-electronics and an air-cooled housing. The simulation results show that the drive provides a maximum torque performance of 133 Nm at 3,600 rpm and a maximum power of 52.9 kW at 4,300 rpm, with peak efficiency above 96% at 4,000 ± 500 rpm and 50 ± 20 Nm, decreasing to 93–94% by including the inverter. These performances are validated with Hardware-in-the-Loop measurements on the prototype, despite small deviations from the operation of the control algorithm, and from the slightly degraded material performance. The proposed drive is finally evaluated based on its machine constant of mechanical power and torque density values, bringing to an improvement of respectively +45% and +25% compared to the 2016 benchmark, thus resulting in the best-in-class ferrite-based PMaSYRM.

A subsystem called the Target SoC Optimizer computes a sequence of target SoCs at specified driving distances along a given trip prediction.

                  This paper proposes a novel hybrid algorithm for simultaneously estimating the vehicle mass and road grade for hybrid electric bus (HEB). First, the road grade in current step is estimated using extended Kalman filter (EKF) with the initial state including velocity and engine torque. Second, the vehicle mass is estimated twice, one with EKF and the other with recursive least square (RLS) using the estimated road grade. A more accurate value of the estimated mass is acquired by weighting the trade-off between EKF and RLS. Finally, the road grade and vehicle mass thus obtained are used as the initial states for the next step, and two variables could be decoupled from the nonlinear vehicle dynamics by performing the above procedure repeatedly. Simulation results show that in different starting conditions, the proposed algorithm provides higher accuracy and faster convergence speed, compared with the results using EKF or RLS alone.

                  With recent developments in autonomous cars, route based optimisation is closer to reality. Penetration of such connected cars technology provides potential for optimisation of fuel consumption. In this paper, look ahead prediction is used along with lumped parameter based models to develop a supervisory controller for a light duty diesel engine. A supervisory interface proposed in earlier works for a light duty diesel engine with LNT-SCR aftertreatment system is used. The supervisory controller is designed with the objective of non-interference of local controllers. However, the ability to influence the subsystem with a system objective is maintained. The look ahead prediction comprises of vehicle speed and load trajectory. A set of discrete control actions are evaluated for the complete powertrain to determine the optimal action with respect to equivalent fuel consumption. The use of the simple models along with discrete control actions has low computational effort. After a full factorial simulation of the discrete actions carried out on-line, the optimal supervisory control action is chosen by selecting the action with least fuel consumption. The simulation results utilising the proposed controller is analysed for fuel equivalent consumption saving potential.

                  An appropriate energy management strategy is able to further improve the fuel economy of PHEVs. The rule-based energy management algorithms are dominated in industry due to their fast computation and ease of establishment potentials, however, their performance differ a lot from improper setting of parameters and control actions. This paper employs the dynamic programming (DP) to locate the optimal actions for the engine in PHEVs, and more importantly, proposes a recalibration method to improve the performance of the rule-based energy management through the results calculated by DP algorithm. Eventually, an optimization-based rule development procedure is presented and further validated by hardware-in-loop (HIL) simulation experiments. The HIL simulation results show that, the improved rule-based energy management strategy reduces fuel consumption per 100km from 25.46L diesel to 22.80L diesel. The main contribution of this study is to explore a novel way to calibrate the existed heuristic control strategy with the global optimization result through advanced intelligent algorithms.

                  The hybrid energy storage system (HESS), which combines the functionalities of supercapacitors (SCs) and batteries, has been widely studied to extend the batteries' lifespan. The battery degradation cost and the electricity cost should be simultaneously considered in the HESS optimization. However, the continuous decline in the price of lithium batteries may weaken the effectiveness of HESS, as the battery degradation cost becomes less important. This paper analyzes the influence of different temperatures and battery prices on the integrated optimization of HESS, including the optimization of SC size and energy management strategy (EMS) for electric vehicle (EV) applications. Based on an average temperature, the HESS performance is examined considering a wide range of battery prices (from $143/kWh in 2028 to $257/kWh in 2018). Simulation results show that both the SC sizing and EMS optimization results are robust to the temperature and the battery price. In addition, the total cost of HESS for customers is shown to be 12% less than a battery energy storage system, even at low battery prices. The HESS is therefore validated to be effective in EV applications in the near future.

                  Fuel cell hybrid vehicles (FCHVs) have become a major topic of interest in the automotive industry owing to recent energy supply and environmental problems. Consequently, fuel economy evaluation methods of FCHVs have a popular research topic. The initial state of charge (SOC) and the final SOC of the battery have to be identical in an evaluation of the fuel economy of an FCHV. In an actual driving situation or during a forward simulation, however, the final SOC depends on the power management strategy, which is usually different from the initial SOC. To consider the effect of the difference between the initial and final SOC on fuel economy evaluation, the concept of equivalent fuel consumption, based on the optimal control, is introduced in this paper. A rule-based power management strategy is applied to an FCHV, and its fuel economy is evaluated in terms of the equivalent fuel consumption and compared to the optimal control result.

                  A polymeric electrolyte Fuel Cell System (FCS) was experimentally studied for application as power generator in hybrid power systems. The electrochemical device was based on 96 individual cells and produced a maximum power of 6.2 kW. A dedicated DC –DC converter was inserted between the FCS, a Pb battery pack used as storage system, and a resistive variable electric load. The whole system was preliminarily characterized to evaluate FCS and DC-DC converter efficiency in the whole power range. The FCS operated at low pressure, without external humidification and in anode recirculation mode. As irregularities of cell voltages could be a sign of draining conditions for catalyzed electrodes and electrolytes, the cell voltage uniformity analysis was effected in both steady state and dynamic conditions. The coefficient of variation (Cv), was used as a measure of dispersion of cell voltage around the mean value. The experimental data evidence a satisfactory behavior of all cells in steady-state conditions in the entire power range (1-6 kW), with FCS+DC-DC converter efficiencies close to 50% and very low Cv values (<1.6%). Stack and cell performance remained high and reliable during most of transient phases of a dynamic test characterized by a high frequency of load variation steps.

                  This paper presents a fuel efficient control strategy for a group of connected hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) in urban road conditions. A hierarchical control architecture is proposed in this paper for every HEV, where the higher level and the lower level controller share information with each other and solve two different problems that aim at improving its fuel efficiency. The higher level controller of each HEV is considered to utilize traffic light information, through vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication, and state information of the vehicles in its near neighborhood, via vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication.

                  This paper provides a methodology and identifies opportunities for battery pack downsizing in a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). A new term of power denial and a new metric of lost energy opportunities are introduced and analyzed in addition to utilization, temperature, life, and cost. A model-based power limiting algorithm is used in computing real-time power capability of the battery. The downsized pack with a shifted SOC window is evaluated in a light-duty HEV. A parameterized electro-thermal model is used to capture voltage, state-of-charge, and temperature. A semi-empirical ageing model is integrated to predict the capacity loss and resistance increase of the downsized pack. The battery ageing model is developed based on a set of experiments carefully designed to clarify the influence of operating SOC on battery degradation. The parametric study shows that the number of cells in the pack could be reduced from 76 to 64 while shifting nominal operating SOC from 50% to 35% without changing the pack energy throughput. This would result in a 19% increase in energy utilization per cell, a 0.5% increase in capacity fade and a 2.9% increase in internal resistance, while the pack cost will be reduced by 10%.

                  This paper presents a comparison between different battery energy storage systems (ESS) suitable for an urban electric bus. The investigation starts from a daily energy consumption analysis of a bus route in term of batteries state of charge (SOC). Specifically, three different ESS configurations are modelled basing on experimental data: LiFePO4 battery pack, LiFePO4 battery coupled with PEM fuel cell stack and a hybrid battery system composed by LiFePO4 and vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs). Moreover, authors provide an evaluation about the battery life through the application of the rainflow-counting algorithm on the yearly SOC trends of each system. As result, the proposed analysis highlights the favorable effect on the ESS due to the introduction of VRFB in the system. The improvements are found both on the net daily operating hours (one hour longer than the conventional case) and on the life expectancy of the LiFePO4 battery (over 9 years, with a gain factor of 5). The obtained results can be considered as a starting point for a wider study focused both on the ESS sizing and on the routes planning of a city buses fleet.

                  In order to efficiently absorb more regenerative braking energy which sustains much longer compared with the conventional vehicle, and guarantee the safety of the hybrid system under the actual driving cycle of locomotive, an energy management control based on dynamic factor strategy is proposed for a scale-down locomotive system which consists of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and battery pack. The proposed strategy which has self-adaption function for different driving cycles aims to achieve the less consumption of hydrogen and higher efficiency of the hybrid system. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy is able to maintain the charge state of battery (SOC) better than Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS), and the proposed strategy could keep the change trend of SOC, which the final SOC is closed to the target value regardless of the initial SOC of battery. Moreover, the hydrogen consumption has been reduced by 0.86g and the efficiency of overall system has been raised of 2% at least than ECMS under the actual driving cycle through the proposed strategy. Therefore, the proposed strategy could improve the efficiency of system by diminishing the conversion process of energy outputted by fuel cell.

                  The interaction between components and energy management is an obstacle for the fuel economy improvement of plug-in hybrid electric buses (PHEBs). Although the systematic method of design, optimization and energy management is recognized as a promising solution, two problems including the robust design of component matching considering the influence of uncertain driving cycles and the integrated design of energy management are still need to be solved. This paper proposes a novelty all-in-one method to address the issues. Firstly, a typical driving cycle construction method for city bus route is proposed to solve the first problem, based on a series of historical driving cycles. Secondly, a co-optimization framework including an outer layer constituted by multi-island genetic algorithm, and an inner layer constituted by dynamic programming (DP) is proposed, to find the best component matching. Specially, in the outer layer, two engines and six motors are taken as discrete design variables, meanwhile, the speed ratios of AMT and final driver are taken as continuous design variables; in the inner layer, the fuel consumption is taken as the objective of the outer layer. Finally, a receding horizon control (RHC)-based energy management strategy together with a predictive model of terminal state of charge (SOC) are proposed to solve the second problem, based on the same DP algorithm in the co-optimization framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed all-in-one method can find the robust component matching; the RHC strategy can realize the real-time control, and its fuel economy is better than the rule-based strategy.

                  Fuel economy improvements and battery energy savings can promote the adoption of parallel mild hybrids for urban driving conditions. The aim of this study is to establish these benefits through two operating modes: an energy saving mode and a fuel saving mode. The performances of a typical parallel mild hybrid using these modes were analysed over urban driving cycles, in the US, Europe, and India, with a particular focus on the Indian urban conditions. The energy pack available from the proposed energy-saving operating mode, in addition to the energy already available from the conventional mode, was observed to be the highest for the representative urban driving cycle of the US. The extra energy pack available was found to be approximately 21.9 times that available from the conventional mode. By employing the proposed fuel saving operating mode, the fuel economy improvement achievable in New York City was observed to be approximately 22.69% of the fuel economy with the conventional strategy. The energy saving strategy was found to possess the lowest payback periods and highest immunity to variations in various cost parameters.

                  Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) can potentially reduce vehicle CO2 emissions by using recuperated kinetic vehicle energy stored as electric energy in a hybrid system battery (HSB). HSB performance affects the individual net HEV CO2 emissions for a given driving pattern, which is considered to be equivalent to unchanged net energy content in the HSB. The present study investigates the influence of HSB performance on the statutory correction procedure used to determine HEV CO2 emissions in Europe based on chassis dynamometer measurements with three identical in-use examples of a full HEV model featuring different mileages. Statutory and real-world driving cycles and full electric vehicle operation modes have been considered. The main observation is that the selected HEVs can only use 67–80% of the charge provided to the HSB, which distorts the outcomes of the statutory correction procedure that does not consider such irreversibility. CO2 emissions corrected according to this procedure underestimate the true net CO2 emissions of one HEV by approximately 13% in real-world urban driving. The correct CO2 emissions are only reproduced when considering the HSB performance in this driving pattern. The statutory procedure for correcting HEV CO2 emissions should, therefore, be adapted.

                  Turbocharged direct injection (TDI) diesel and hybridized electric gasoline (HEV) vehicles provide higher fuel economy, but have higher manufacturing costs and sell at higher prices than conventional gasoline vehicles. All other attributes being equal, rational consumers expect to recover this price premium in fuel savings over the vehicle lifetime. Since many owners sell their vehicle after three to five years, resale prices should also reflect fuel savings. Here, we employ data from used vehicle auctions in 2008–2009 for paired alternative and conventional vehicles to compare the difference in resale prices to the expected fuel savings and the five-year cost of ownership expressed as the net present value (NPV). To estimate resale prices,we group the auction data by season and by year. We then correct for accumulated odometer mileage, which accounts for most of the variability in prices. At five years, higher fuel economy vehicles retain a higher proportion of their initial price than conventional options. The ratio of the resale value to the initial purchase price increases at higher fuel prices. For the paired HEV – conventional passenger vehicles, the difference in resale prices approximates the expected future fuel savings. The price difference for TDI diesel–gasoline pairs exceeds the fuel savings; other attributes such as performance or prestige may account for this difference. Regardless of the mechanism, the fuel savings and higher resale values compensate for the price premium for the TDI diesel and HEV options.

Furthermore, at each 1C discharged aging characterization stage, the parameters of a physics-based electrochemical cell model were identified using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Among the parameters that can be identified with sufficient accuracy from the experimental data, the concentration of lithium-ions at the negative electrode after full charge is found to be strongly correlated with the system-level loss of capacity.

The driving cycle is divided into micro-trips, and a fuzzy pattern recognition algorithm is proposed to distinguish different micro-trips within a driving cycle. The intensity factor indicates how intensely the micro-trip drains energy from the hybrid energy storage system. The distribution of each driving cycle is analyzed by the probability density function. The integrated optimization of the hybrid energy storage system is conducted based on four driving cycles. Simulation results show that for different driving cycles, the optimal supercapacitor size and the on-line energy management strategy are directly determined by the maximum intensity factor. The driving cycles with similar maximum intensity factors can use same amount of supercapacitor modules and employ the same on-line energy management strategy. Therefore, the optimization results can be easily generalized to practical bus lines.

                  Hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) and battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) are currently more expensive than conventional passenger cars but may become cheaper due to technological learning. Here, we obtain insight into the prospects of future price decline by establishing ex-post learning rates for HEVs and ex-ante price forecasts for HEVs and BEVs. Since 1997, HEVs have shown a robust decline in their price and price differential at learning rates of 7±2% and 23±5%, respectively. By 2010, HEVs were only 31±22€2010

We estimate that BEVs may require until then global learning investments of 100–150 billion € which is less than the global subsidies for fossil fuel consumption paid in 2009. These findings suggest that HEVs, including plug-in HEVs, could become the dominant vehicle technology in the next two decades, while BEVs may require long-term policy support.

                  This paper presents an adaptive supervisory controller, based on Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle (PMP), for on-line energy management optimization of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. Using minimum driving information, such as the total trip length and the average cycle speed, the proposed algorithm relies on adaptation of the control parameter from state of charge feedback. The proposed strategy is referred in the paper to as Adaptive-PMP (A-PMP). The new controller is applied to a detailed forward vehicle simulator of the plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt manufactured by General Motors, where an experimentally validated LG Chem battery model is used. The strategy we propose aims at achieving a blended trajectory of the state of charge to minimize the consumed fuel, resulting in an overall better performance than the actual Charge Depleting/Charge Sustaining (CD/CS) strategy currently used on-board of the vehicle. A comparative analysis of three strategies, i.e., the optimal one (PMP), the proposed one (A-PMP) and the in-vehicle one (CD/CS), is conducted in simulation which shows that improvement above 20% in fuel consumption may be achieved when the proposed algorithm is used instead of the current on-board strategy.

                  The low temperature combustion is required for an internal combustion gasoline engine to achieve higher thermal efficiency and lower NOx emissions. The gasoline controlled auto-ignition (CAI) has been extensively researched to achieve low temperature combustion but its lack of control in combustion process has limited its applications. To overcome this problem, dimethyl ether (DME) is directly injected into the cylinder to generate multiple micro-flame ignition sites and regulate the entire heat release of premixed gasoline mixture. This micro-flame ignited (MFI) hybrid combustion was achieved in a 4-stroke gasoline engine in this work. The results show that the heat release process consists of three stages: stage I of low temperature oxidation reactions, followed with a short delay of a few crank angles by stage II of high temperature reactions of DME and the main combustion of premixed gasoline mixture in stage III. With the increased amount of DME in the late injection, the start of main combustion advances and the combustion duration reduces for both single and split injections, which results in lower HC and CO emissions. The introduction of split DME injections improves the combustion process and reduces HC and CO emissions as well as the maximum thermal efficiency.

The power threshold at which engine is turned on is optimized by genetic algorithm (GA) based on vehicle fuel-rate, battery state of charge (SOC) and driveline power demand. The optimal battery current when the engine is on is calculated using quadratic programming (QP) method. The proposed algorithm can control the battery current effectively, which makes the engine work more efficiently and thus reduce the fuel-consumption. Moreover, the controller is still applicable when the battery is unhealthy. Numerical simulations validated the feasibility of the proposed controller.

We first reformulate the optimization problem to become separable in space (optimization variables). The problem is then decomposed into two optimization problems. The first is a static problem that looks for the optimal engine speed that maximizes efficiency of a compound unit, resembling an engine- generator unit combining the planetary gear and kinetic energy converters connected to it. The second is a dynamic optimization problem deciding the optimal power split between an electric buffer and the compound unit. By approximating the losses of the compound unit as convex, second order polynomial in generated power, we are able to solve the power split problem in less than 2 seconds, when the engine on/off sequence is known in advance. By comparing results with dynamic programming, we observed an approximation error of less than 0.2%.

                  The energy management strategy (EMS) is a key to reduce the equivalent hydrogen consumption and slow down fuel cell performance degradation of the plug-in fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles. Global optimal EMS based on the whole trip information can achieve the minimum hydrogen consumption, but it is difficult to apply in real driving. This paper tries to solve this problem with a novel hierarchical EMS proposed to realize the real-time application and approximate global optimization. The long-term average speed in each future trip segment is predicted by KNN, and the short-term speed series is predicted by a new model averaging method. The approximate global optimization is realized by introducing hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), and the strategy within the speed forecast window is optimized by introducing upper confidence tree search (UCTS). The vehicle speed prediction and the proposed EMS have been verified using the collected real driving cycles. The results show that the proposed strategy can adapt to driving style changes through self-learning. Compared with the widely used rule-based strategy, it can evidently reduce hydrogen consumption by 6.14% and fuel cell start-stop times by 21.7% on average to suppress the aging of fuel cell. Moreover, its computation time is less than 0.447 s at each step, and combined with rolling optimization, it can be used for real-time application.

                           The prototype “Toyota Prius II Hybrid CNG Vehicle”, developed with IFP Energies Nouvelles, combines a natural gas thermal engine with a hybrid electric motorization. After optimization, CO2 emissions, measured on chassis dynamometer, were 76g/km on NEDC cycle.

                           The use of raw biogas in CNG Vehicle has been explored. These tests have shown that raw biogas (not upgraded) can be used as a fuel, if blended with natural gas. In fact, the use of raw biogas can be envisaged in dedicated CNG engines, if new engine technologies (lean CNG combustion) are developed. In such a case natural gas can be blended with up to 70% volume of not upgraded biogas.
                        
                        
                           •
                           The potential reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions related both to the optimization of the CNG vehicle and to the use of biomethane as a vehicle fuel has been evaluated.
                        
                        
                           GHG emissions from CNG vehicles (mono-fuel and hybrid) may be significantly lower than emissions of gasoline vehicles: around 17% lower in the case of dedicated CNG Vehicle and up to 51% lower in the case of hybrid CNG vehicles.
                        
                        
                           In addition, biomethane (from the anaerobic digestion of waste) brings the GHG emission levels, over the course of the life cycle, down to more than 80% compared to a gasoline vehicle. Emission levels are lowered by 87% in the case of the Toyota Prius CNG Hybrid prototype fuelled by biomethane produced from waste (in comparison to a gasoline vehicle).
                        
                        
                           Thus, biomethane allows a reduction of GHG emissions far below the minimum required by the European Directive on the Promotion of Renewable Energy Sources (2009/28/EC).

                  The waste treatment related to the End-of-Life phase of durable goods such as electric and electronic equipment and road vehicles is increasingly regulated both from a European and a worldwide point of view. Regarding the transport sector, most L-class vehicles (mopeds, motorcycles, tricycles, quadricycles as defined in Regulation 168/2013/EU) are not fully subjected to the Directive 2000/53/EC, which is the reference for other light vehicle categories. The recent introduction of novel archetypes and innovative powertrains for L-vehicles suggests that such products represent an actual alternative to full conventional vehicles for urban mobility; however, only limited data are available regarding their Recyclability and Recoverability. In order to cover such gap, a comprehensive view of L-class vehicle characteristics from End-of-Life perspective is proposed. The objectives of the study are the definition and the critical analysis of the context in which L-class vehicles are supposed to be treated, the identification of End-of-Life assessment methodologies and the application on a case study. Two different methodologies are compared; both come from other transport sectors. The methodologies differ in terms of performance assessment of recycling and recovery processes.
                  The treatment of the vehicle has been reproduced in controlled condition to obtain a detailed inventory of parts. Furthermore, four different hypotheses regarding the accuracy of the treatment have been formulated. The data have been used to estimate vehicle Recyclability and Recoverability rates under the proposed scenarios. The results demonstrate the compliance of Recyclability and Recoverability rates according to the most demanding regulation adopted for automotive products, even if such characteristics are not type approval requirements. The comparison between the two assessment methods shows that satisfactory Recyclability and Recoverability values can be achieved also considering technological limitations, at the cost of increased dismantling effort. The variability of results on the basis of external conditions is calculated, estimating four cases from “worst” to “best” option. The discrepancies between the results of the two assessments methods and the relation to realistic limitations are discussed.
                  Using the first assessment method – ISO 22628 – it is calculated that the dismantling of the bodywork is sufficient to achieve a 85% recyclability result, and higher values are obtained in case of favorable scenario; Recoverability is also assessed to be above 95%. Using a method taking into account technological limitations – UNIFE assessment, adapted from railway sector – lower values are calculated, the reduction being from 1% to 3% for Recyclability and from 3% to 15% for Recoverability, depending on the boundary conditions considered.
                  Further research should be done to improve the assessment methods and to estimate the effective waste production arising from vehicle treatment, thus identifying physical and technological limits in relation to the product and to the context under study. For the sector of L-class vehicles, the study should be extended to a range of products, validating data through on-field trials.
               ","f-Life phase of durable goods such as electric and electronic equipment and road vehicles is increasingly regulated both from a European and a worldwide point of view. Regarding the transport sector, most L-class vehicles (mopeds, motorcycles, tricycles, quadricycles as defined in Regulation 168/2013/EU) are not fully subjected to the Directive 2000/53/EC, which is the reference for other light vehicle categories. The recent introduction of novel archetypes and innovative powertrains for L-vehicles suggests that such products represent an actual alternative to full conventional vehicles for urban mobility; however, only limited data are available regarding their Recyclability and Recoverability. In order to cover such gap, a comprehensive view of L-class vehicle characteristics from End-of-Life perspective is proposed. The objectives of the study are the definition and the critical analysis of the context in which L-class vehicles are supposed to be treated, the identification of End-of-Life assessment methodologies and the application on a case study. Two different methodologies are compared; both come from other transport sectors. The methodologies differ in terms of performance assessment of recycling and recovery processes.
                  The treatment of the vehicle has been reproduced in controlled condition to obtain a detailed inventory of parts. Furthermore, four different hypotheses regarding the accuracy of the treatment have been formulated. The data have been used to estimate vehicle Recyclability and Recoverability rates under the proposed scenarios. The results demonstrate the compliance of Recyclability and Recoverability rates according to the most demanding regulation adopted for automotive products, even if such characteristics are not type approval requirements.

                  Energy consumption and exhaust emissions of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) strongly depend on the HEV topology, power ratios of the components and applied control strategy. There are many available patterns of combining the power flows to meet load requirements making it difficult to analyze and evaluate a newly designed HEV. In order to enhance design of HEVs, the paper provides a stand alone analytical framework for evaluating energy conversion phenomena of different HEV topologies. Analytical analysis is based on the energy balance equations and considers the complete energy path in the HEVs from the energy sources to the wheels and to other energy sinks. The analytical framework enables structuring large amount of data in physically meaningful energy flows and associated energy losses, and therefore provides insightful information for HEV optimization. It therefore enables identification of most suitable HEV topology and of most suitable power ratios of the components, since it reveals and quantifies the instruments that could lead to improved energy conversion efficiency of particular HEV. The analytical framework is also applicable for correcting the energy consumption of the HEV to the value corresponding to balanced energy content of the electric storage devices.

                  In this paper the problem of online-optimizing the steady-state efficiency of a hybrid single-cylinder diesel power unit is considered. The special characteristic of the proposed concept is using the time path of the crankshaft position during one combustion cycle as an optimization variable. The problem can be stated in terms of an optimal control problem with free terminal time, which is solved by applying the model-free optimization scheme extremum seeking control. It is shown that by using a parameterization of the reference input based on trigonometric basis functions the evolution of the performance index can be modeled as a discrete-time nonlinear and multivariable system with a non-constant sampling interval. To this system the discrete-time variant of ES can be directly applied. An advantage of the proposed method is that no modeling of the thermodynamic processes is required. The robustness and accuracy of the concept is at first studied through simulations. Furthermore, experimental results are presented demonstrating the need for a model-free optimization and the beneficial property of the concept’s adaptation capability.

                  The reduction of transport-generated CO2 emissions is currently a problem of global interest. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are considered as one promising technological solution for limiting transport-generated greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, the number of HEVs in the market remains limited, but this picture will change in the years to come as HEVs are expected to pave the way for cleaner technologies in transport. In this paper, results are presented regarding fuel economy and pollutant emissions measurements of two hybrid electric production vehicles. The measurements were conducted on a Prius II and a Honda Civic IMA using both the European legislated driving cycle (New European Driving Cycle, NEDC) and real-world simulation driving cycles (Artemis). In addition to the emissions measurements, other vehicle-operating parameters were studied in an effort to better quantify the maximum CO2 reduction potential. Data from real-world operation of a Prius II vehicle were also used in the evaluation. Results indicate that in most cases both vehicles present improved energy efficiency and pollutant emissions compared to conventional cars. The fuel economy benefit of the two HEVs peaked under urban driving conditions where reductions of 60% and 40% were observed, respectively. Over higher speeds the difference in fuel economy was lower, reaching that of conventional diesel at 95kmh−1. The effect of ambient temperature on fuel consumption was also quantified. It is concluded that urban operation benefits the most of hybrid technology, leading to important fuel savings and urban air quality improvement.

                  This paper proposes a global driving cycle construction method based on the real-time traffic information, which can realize online optimal energy management for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The construction method is mainly divided into three parts: the construction of velocity segments database; the construction of real-time traffic information tensor model database, and the construction of real-time global driving cycle. For the acquisition of the real-time traffic information, a two-step completion method is adopted to obtain the complete and accuracy traffic information; for the driving cycle construction, the velocity segment database, the road section velocity and the Markov transfer matrix with Monte Carlo are used to generate velocity segments which constitute the global driving cycle. With the updated real-time traffic information, the global driving cycle is reconstructed which further reflect the real-time road condition. The efficient dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is applied to realize online energy management in PHEVs. Its simulation shows that the fuel efficiency improves by at least 19.83% compared with charge depleting and charge sustain (CDCS) control strategy.

The construction method is mainly divided into three parts: the construction of velocity segments database; the construction of real-time traffic information tensor model database, and the construction of real-time global driving cycle. For the acquisition of the real-time traffic information, a two-step completion method is adopted to obtain the complete and accuracy traffic information; for the driving cycle construction, the velocity segment database, the road section velocity and the Markov transfer matrix with Monte Carlo are used to generate velocity segments which constitute the global driving cycle. With the updated real-time traffic information, the global driving cycle is reconstructed which further reflect the real-time road condition. The efficient dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is applied to realize online energy management in PHEVs. Its simulation shows that the fuel efficiency improves by at least 19.83% compared with charge depleting and charge sustain (CDCS) control strategy.

                  In parallel hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), the power split between the engine and the electric motor as well as the gear shift in the gearbox determines the overall energy efficiency. In this paper an adaptive energy management strategy with velocity forecast is proposed to optimize the fuel consumption in parallel HEVs, which is formulated into a mixed-integer optimization problem. Approximate dynamic programming with a novel actor-gear-critic design is presented for simultaneously controlling the power split and gear shift online. The power split as a continuous variable is determined from an actor network to realize the energy distribution between two power sources. The gear shift as a discrete variable is obtained from a gear network to adjust the gear ratio in the gearbox. The concept enables an online learning of the energy management strategy for different driving behaviors without the requirement of a system model and the driving cycle. Simulation results indicate that the proposed strategy achieves close fuel economy compared with the optimal solutions resulting from dynamic programming. Furthermore, a multi-stage neural network is introduced for velocity forecast, providing a computationally efficient training framework with good prediction performance. The velocity prediction is finally combined with the energy management strategy for an effective application and fuel economy.

This study contributes to the development of a methodology for the circulating power-flow analysis of a planetary gear drive with two inputs and one output. This approach is generic and an illustration is presented to demonstrate its applicability to a hybrid planetary gear configuration. It is found that circulating power depends on planetary gear ratios and speed ratio of two power sources.

                  This paper presents an optimization approach for optimal component sizing of PEM fuel cell (PEMFC)-battery hybrid energy system (HES) to provide the driving force required to haul passenger trains. The objective function is the minimization of the cost of HES, which subjects to the constraints of battery state-of-charge limit, PEMFC capacity constraint, and the instantaneous power balance constraint. A model of PEMFC-battery HES suitable for locomotive application is formulated. Two energy management strategies (EMS) are proposed to ensure the balance between instantaneous power demand and supply.

                  In this paper, a multi-level, comprehensive control technique for a heavy duty vehicle, capable of reducing fuel consumption while complying with engine constraints on both operating conditions and smoke emissions has been developed. The higher control layer, using road data, engine and vehicle parameters, computes the optimal speed and gear shifting profiles through an off-line, dual step dynamic programming algorithm. Since fuel consumption alone could be potentially decreased by driving at lower speeds and thus increasing travel time, this last aspect is also taken into account in the presented algorithm. The lower control layer, operating in real time, computes suitable powertrain control signals assuring the tracking of both reference speed and gear trajectories, while respecting the constraints imposed on engine operation. After the general description of the optimal control problem aimed at minimizing fuel consumption, an approach for its solution, implemented in the higher control layer, is presented. Afterwards, the lower control layer is described. In conclusion, the effectiveness of the developed control structure and the achievable improvement in terms of fuel consumption in comparison with a traditional fixed-point cruise controller are assessed through simulations in different driving scenarios.

                  A novel updating method of equivalent factor of the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) is proposed to prolong the lifetime of battery in fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle. ECMS can generate the sub-optimal solution at any instance for current driving condition. Equivalent factor which is dimensionless conversion ratio of electrical power flow into chemical power flow plays an important role in charge-sustaining performance. Well-tuned equivalent factor from iterative search in off-line can only guarantee the charge-sustaining performance, not the lifetime of the battery. Therefore additional updating method of equivalent factor is necessary in order to prolong the lifetime of the battery which only takes the numbers of charge and discharge cycle into account. Backward simulation is used to verify the effectiveness of the updating method.

                  This paper presents a controller for use in speed control of an internal combustion engine for series-hybrid electric vehicle applications. Particular reference is made to the stability of the rectified DC link voltage under load disturbance. In the system under consideration, the primary power source is a four-cylinder normally aspirated gasoline internal combustion engine, which is mechanically coupled to a three-phase permanent magnet AC generator. The generated AC voltage is subsequently rectified to supply a lead-acid battery, and permanent magnet traction motors via three-phase full bridge power electronic inverters. Two complementary performance objectives exist. Firstly to maintain the internal combustion engine at its optimal operating point, and secondly to supply a stable 42 V supply to the traction drive inverters. Achievement of these goals minimises the transient energy storage requirements at the DC link, with a consequent reduction in both weight and cost. These objectives imply constant velocity operation of the internal combustion engine under external load disturbances and changes in both operating conditions and vehicle speed set-points. An electronically operated throttle allows closed loop engine velocity control. System time delays and nonlinearities render closed loop control design extremely problematic. A model-based controller is designed and shown to be effective in controlling the DC link voltage, resulting in the well-conditioned operation of the hybrid vehicle.

This paper proposes a reconstructed fuel cell life-prediction model to estimate the fuel cell lifetime adopted in a city bus. Considering the temperature fluctuation and sensor errors, the voltage model is separated into three parts to simplify the fitting process, and the validation results show that the proposed degradation model is credible and robust. Furthermore, the 14-day training data show that the deviation of the predicted voltage is less than 1%. In this study, the most important innovation is separating the time into different categories.

                  This article examines the problem of estimating the aggregate load imposed on the power grid by the battery health-conscious charging of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The article begins by generating a set of representative daily trips using (i) the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) and (ii) a Markov chain model of both federal and naturalistic drive cycles. A multi-objective optimizer then uses each of these trips, together with PHEV powertrain and battery degradation models, to optimize both PHEV daily energy cost and battery degradation. The optimizer achieves this by varying (i) the amounts of charge obtained from the grid by each PHEV, and (ii) the timing of this charging. The article finally computes aggregate PHEV power demand by accumulating the charge patterns optimized for individual PHEV trips. The results of this aggregation process show a peak PHEV load in the early morning (between 5.00 and 6.00a.m.), with approximately half of all PHEVs charging simultaneously. The ability to charge at work introduces smaller additional peaks in the aggregate load pattern. The article concludes by exploring the sensitivity of these results to the relative weighting of the two optimization objectives (energy cost and battery health), battery size, and electricity price.

                  Growing concerns about reducing fuel consumption and global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have forced the shipping industry to accelerate the development of plug-in hybrid electric propulsion systems (HEPSs). However, the design optimization of plug-in HEPSs with the single objective of saving fuel may result in increased GHG emissions. This study proposes a bi-objective optimization by considering not only fuel consumption but also GHG emissions. The NSGA-II method is developed to explore the Pareto optimal solution set. A real-time hardware-in-the-loop experimental platform is built to validate the effectiveness of the optimization. The experimental results show that the optimal design selected from the Pareto solution set of the bi-objective optimization is closer to the ideal point than the optimal designs via the single-objective optimization pursuing either minimum fuel consumption or minimum GHG emissions. Further, sensitivity analysis is conducted. It is found that three variables (motor rotor diameter, motor rotor length, and gear ratio) are of local optimum at the Pareto front; and two (number of battery modules and lower bound of the battery state of charge) are of strong sensitivity regarding the contradiction between fuel consumption and GHG emissions.

                  This paper presents the comparative study of two hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) of a two front wheel driven electric vehicle. The primary energy source of the HESS is a Li-Ion battery, whereas the secondary energy source is either an ultracapacitor (UC) or a flywheel energy system (FES). The main role of the secondary source is to deliver/recover energy during high peak power demand, but also to increase battery lifetime, considered among the most expensive items in the electric vehicle. As a first step, a techno-economic comparative study, supported by strong literature research, is performed between the UC and the FES. The design and sizing of each element will be presented. The comparison criteria and specifications are also described. The adopted approach in this paper is based on an academic non-oriented point of view. In a second step, each of the HESS will be integrated in a more global Simulink model which includes the vehicle model, the traction control system (TCS), the regenerative braking system and the vehicle actuators. Simulation tests are performed for an extreme braking and vehicle starting-up operations. Tests are realized on two different surface road types and conditions (high and low friction roads) and for different initial system states. In order to show the most appropriate storage system regarding compactness, weight and battery constraints minimization, deep comparative analysis is provided.

                  This paper presents a simple, robust controller for use in speed control of an internal combustion engine for series-hybrid electric vehicle applications. Particular reference is made to the stability of the rectified DC link voltage under load disturbance and potentially inaccurate system models. In the system under consideration, the primary power source is a 4-cylinder normally aspirated gasoline internal combustion engine, which is mechanically coupled to a three-phase permanent magnet AC generator. The generated AC voltage is subsequently rectified to supply a lead-acid battery, and permanent magnet traction motors via three-phase full bridge power electronic inverters. Two complementary performance objectives exist. Firstly to maintain the internal combustion engine at its optimal operating point, and secondly to supply a stable 42V supply to the traction drive inverters. Achievement of these goals minimises the transient energy storage requirements at the DC link, with a consequent reduction in both weight and cost. These objectives imply constant velocity operation of the internal combustion engine under external load disturbances and changes in both operating conditions and vehicle speed set-points. An electronically operated throttle allows closed loop engine velocity control. System time-delays and non-linearities render closed loop control design extremely problematic. A model based controller is designed and shown to be robust in controlling the DC link voltage, resulting in well-conditioned operation of the hybrid vehicle.

                  The idea of Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS) lies on the fact that heterogeneous Energy Storage System (ESS) technologies have complementary characteristics in terms of power and energy density, life cycle, response rate, and so on. In other words, high power ESS devices possess fast response rate while in the contrary, high energy ESS devices possess slow response rate. Therefore, it may be beneficial to hybridize ESS technologies in the way that synergize functional advantages of two heterogeneous existing ESS technologies As a consequence, this hybridization provides excellent characteristics not offered by a single ESS unit. This new technology has been proposed and investigated by several researchers in the literature particularly in the fields of renewable energy and electrified transport sector.

                  The BMW Group has launched two micro-hybrid functions in high volume models in order to contribute to reduction of fuel consumption in modern passenger cars. Both the brake energy regeneration (BER) and the auto-start-stop function (ASSF) are based on the conventional 14V vehicle electrical system and current series components with only little modifications. An intelligent control algorithm of the alternator enables recuperative charging in braking and coasting phases, known as BER. By switching off the internal combustion engine at a vehicle standstill the idling fuel consumption is effectively reduced by ASSF. By reason of economy and package a lead–acid battery is used as electrochemical energy storage device.
                  The BMW Group assembles valve-regulated lead–acid (VRLA) batteries in absorbent glass mat (AGM) technology in the micro-hybrid electrical power system since special challenges arise for the batteries. By field data analysis a lower average state-of-charge (SOC) due to partial state-of-charge (PSOC) operation and a higher cycling rate due to BER and ASSF are confirmed in this article.
                  Similar to a design of experiment (DOE) like method we present a long-term lab investigation. Two types of 90Ah VRLA AGM batteries are operated with a test bench profile that simulates the micro-hybrid vehicle electrical system under varying conditions. The main attention of this lab testing is focused on capacity loss and charge acceptance over cycle life. These effects are put into context with periodically refresh charging the batteries in order to prevent accelerated battery aging due to hard sulfation. We demonstrate the positive effect of refresh chargings concerning preservation of battery charge acceptance. Furthermore, we observe moderate capacity loss over 90 full cycles both at 25°C and at 3°C battery temperature.

                  This paper analyses inter- and intra-organisational interaction in cases of product development, which involves significantly new technologies that affect core product sub-systems. The analysis shows that in such cases, there is a need to collaborate with suppliers to learn about the new technology. Moreover, provided that the firm's existing technology is still relevant, there is a need to integrate the new technology with existing technologies. Therefore, close supplier interaction has to be associated with close intra-organisational interaction. However, even a case where there is a limited need to integrate the new technology with existing technologies, there is a need to justify the new technology internally and negotiate the process of adopting it within the organisation. The paper thus demonstrates a two-way relationship between organisational characteristics and multi-level technological change. On the one hand, different types of technological changes demand different kinds of R&D organisations and supplier relationships. On the other hand, decisions to implement technological changes are influenced by existing organisational structures and product development philosophies.

                  A feasibility study and techno-economic analysis for a hybrid power system intended for vehicular traction applications has been performed. The hybrid consists of an intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cell (IT-SOFC) operating at 500–800°C and a sodium–nickel chloride (ZEBRA) battery operating at 300°C. Such a hybrid system has the benefits of extended range and fuel flexibility (due to the IT-SOFC), high power output and rapid response time (due to the battery). The above hybrid has been compared to a fuel cell-only, a battery-only and an ICE vehicle. It is shown that the capital cost associated with a fuel cell-only vehicle is still much higher than that of any other power source option and that a battery-only option would potentially encounter weight and volume limitations, particularly for long drive times. It is concluded that increasing drive time per day decreases substantially the payback time in relation to an ICE vehicle running on gasoline and thus that the hybrid vehicle is an economically attractive option for commercial vehicles with long drive times. In the case where the battery has reached volume production prices at £70kWh−1 and current fuel duty values remain unchanged then a payback time <2 years is obtained. For a light delivery van operating with 6h drive time per day, a fuel cell system model predicted a gasoline equivalent fuel economy of 25.1kmL−1, almost twice that of a gasoline fuelled ICE vehicle of the same size, and CO2 emissions of 71.6gkm−1, well below any new technology target set so far. It is therefore recommended that a SOFC/ZEBRA demonstration be built to further explore its viability.

                  This paper proposes an optimal energy management strategy based on the approximate Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle (A-PMP) algorithm for parallel plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). When the driving cycles are known in advance, the Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle (PMP) can help to achieve the best fuel economy, but real-time control has been unavailable due to the massive computational load required by instantaneous Hamiltonian optimization. After observing some regular patterns in numeric PMP results, we were inspired to apply a novel piecewise linear approximation strategy by specifying the turning point of the engine fuel rate for the Hamiltonian optimization. As a result, the instantaneous Hamiltonian optimization becomes convex. Considering the engine state, there are only five candidate solutions for the optimization. For the engine off state, only one of the available torque split ratios (TSR) is one of these five candidates. The other four TSR candidates are for the engine on state, including the TSR when the engine operates at the best efficiency point for the current speed, the TSR when the engine delivers all the required torque and two terminal TSRs. The optimal TSR is the one with the smallest Hamiltonian of the current engine state. The engine state with the smallest Hamiltonian will be requested for the next time step. The results show that the A-PMP strategy reduced fuel consumption by 6.96% compared with the conventional “All-Electric, Charge-Sustaining” (AE–CS) strategy. In addition, the A-PMP shortened the simulation time from 6h to only 4min, when compared with the numeric PMP method. Unlike other approximation methods, the proposed novel piecewise linear approximation caused no severe distortion to the engine map model. The engine state switching frequency is also reduced by 43.40% via both the filter and the corresponding engine on/off optimal control strategy.

The dynamic model of the machine shows that non-sequential currents producing no torque appear and degrade the quality of currents. Further, the fuzzy logic controller is proposed to filter non-sequential components and improves the quality energy. Hybridization of the electric vehicle by a fuel cell (HEV) and an auxiliary energy source has the advantage of improving the dynamic response and efficiency of the system. Indeed, an ultra-capacitor (UC) used as a means of energy storage to enable the lower dynamic FC when changes in power fast and recovers braking energy as well as absorption of immanent disturbances of the static converters. Improving the quality of energy demand can improve not only the lifetime of the actuator but also the onboard sources. One of the results of the reduction of interference in the system induces to the reduction of mechanical vibrations, which generates quieter systems, which is an advantage for these urban transport applications. In this paper, the modeling of the different parts of the multi-physical system that represent hybrid vehicle are presented.

                  The energy management problem of finding the optimal split between the different sources of energy in a charge-sustaining parallel HEV, ensuring stability and optimality with respect to a performance objective (fuel consumption minimization over a driving cycle), is addressed in this paper. The paper develops a generic stability and optimality framework within which the energy management problem is cast in the form of a nonlinear optimal regulation (with disturbance rejection) problem and a control Lyapunov function is used to design the control law. Two theorems ensuring optimality and asymptotic stability of the energy management strategy are proposed and proved. The sufficient conditions for optimality and stability are used to derive an analytical expression for the control law as a function of the battery state of charge/state of energy and system parameters. The control law is implemented in a simplified backward vehicle simulator and its performance is evaluated against the global optimal solution obtained from dynamic programming. The strategy performs within 4% of the benchmark solution while guaranteeing optimality and stability for any driving cycle.

The considered architecture is an integrated rule-based metaheuristic approach that combines the simplicity and the effectiveness of rule based and optimization approaches. Online results compared with benchmark offline Ant Colony Optimization results, present near to optimal performance, with slightly better performance for Particle Swarm Optimization versus Genetic Algorithm. The durability of the main energy source which is a crucial issue for Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicles is considered by limiting the Fuel Cell power variation rate in both layers providing a high protection level in order to respect its slow dynamics that represent a critical operational limitation. The rule-based layer which is a strategic layer reduces computational effort and time and restricts the search space of the optimization layer allowing a rapid convergence and thus enabling real time applications. Integrated Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm achieved lower computational time with an average of 0.65 ms versus 43.09 ms for the integrated Genetic Algorithm for each time step, which makes it more suitable for real time applications.

A stability analysis is given for the resulting adaptive control system. Furthermore, it is shown that the intersampling compensation can be designed such that for any given sampling rate, the asymptotic tracking performance of the closed-loop hybrid adaptive control system can be made arbitrarily close to that of the continuous adaptive control system.

                  Recently, automakers have invested heavily in alternative fuel technologies to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from vehicles. Yet we know comparatively little about how automakers work collaboratively with their suppliers to develop inter-organizational eco-innovations. We address this research gap and contribute to the eco-innovation literature by investigating whether suppliers' eco-innovation capabilities in electric, hybrid, and fuel cell technologies influence the degree of eco-innovation co-patenting between Toyota and its suppliers. We also expand research in the strategic alliance literature by exploring the moderating effects of alliance partner diversity. To test our research hypotheses we use data from firms in the Toyota supplier association together with negative binomial and zero-inflated negative binomial regression models. Our empirical results demonstrate that supplier electric capabilities and supplier hybrid capabilities are positively related to the occurrence of eco-innovation co-patents. However, supplier fuel cell capabilities have no effect on eco-innovation co-patenting, especially as firms often choose to develop this technology in-house. Moreover, alliance partner diversity has a negative moderating effect on the relationships between supplier electric capabilities, supplier hybrid capabilities, and eco-innovation co-patents. Finally, we evaluate how our findings from the Toyota supplier association compare to similar Japanese automakers and their supplier networks.

                  Many hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) energy management strategies are developed and evaluated under fixed driving cycles. However in the real-world driving, vehicles are very unlikely to keep running under a fixed known cycle. Instead, a lot of vehicles run on fixed routes. Unfortunately, human driving data collected on a driving simulator shows that it is very difficult to select or create a determined typical driving cycle to represent the fixed-route driving due to the uncertainties in traffic light stops and driver behaviors. This paper presents a two-level stochastic approach to optimize the energy management strategy for fixed-route HEVs. The historical data on the fixed route are utilized and a road-segment-based stochastic HEV energy consumption model is built. The higher-level energy optimization problem is solved by stochastic dynamic programming (SDP). The SDP computation uses the vehicle model and historical driving data on the fixed route and it can be conducted offline. The result of SDP is a 2-dimension lookup table of parameters for lower-level control strategy therefore this approach can be easily real-time implemented in practice. The developed stochastic approach is compared with three strategies using the data collected on the driving simulator: the optimal energy consumption by assuming all trip information is known in advance and solved via dynamic programming (DP), a determined energy management approach using typical trip data of the fixed-route driving, and a simple strategy which does not require any route data. Simulation results show that the proposed stochastic energy management strategy consumes 1.8% more energy than the optimal result after 24 trips on the fixed route and considerably outperforms the other two real-time HEV energy management strategies.

                  Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) provide large potential to save energy and reduce emission, and smart vehicles bring out great convenience and safety for drivers. By combining these two technologies, vehicles may achieve excellent performances in terms of dynamic, economy, environmental friendliness, safety, and comfort. Hence, a smart hybrid electric vehicle (s-HEV) is selected as a platform in this paper to study a car-following process with optimizing the fuel consumption. The whole process is a multi-objective optimal problem, whose optimal solution is not just adding an energy management strategy (EMS) to an adaptive cruise control (ACC), but a deep fusion of these two methods. The problem has more restricted conditions, optimal objectives, and system states, which may result in larger computing burden. Therefore, a novel fuel consumption optimization algorithm based on model predictive control (MPC) is proposed and some search skills are adopted in receding horizon optimization to reduce computing burden. Simulations are carried out and the results indicate that the fuel consumption of proposed method is lower than that of the ACC+EMS method on the condition of ensuring car-following performances.

                  Several types of power management strategies have been developed to improve the fuel economy of fuel cell hybrid vehicles (FCHVs). Optimal control based on the Minimum Principle provides the necessary optimality conditions which minimize fuel consumption and optimize the power distribution between power sources while the vehicle is being driven. In the optimal control scheme, the costate is an equivalent parameter between fuel usage and electric usage. The optimal trajectory of the costate can be derived from one of the necessary conditions. In this paper, an optimal control scheme based on the Minimum Principle is proposed for cases without a state constraint and for those with a state constraint. The conditions in which a variable costate can be replaced with a constant costate are presented. The simulation results with constant costates are compared to those with variable costates in order to prove that variable costates can be replaced with constant costates when using the proposed optimal control scheme.

                  To achieve the optimal energy allocation for the engine-generator, battery and ultracapacitor of a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, a novel adaptive energy management strategy has been proposed. Three efforts have been made. First, the hierarchical control strategy has been proposed for multiple energy sources from a multi-scale view. The upper level is for regulating the energy between the engine-generator and hybrid energy-storage system, while the lower level is for the battery and ultracapacitor. Second, a driving pattern recognition based adaptive energy management approach has been proposed. This approach uses a fuzzy logic controller to classify typical driving cycles into different driving patterns and to identify the real-time driving pattern. Dynamic programming has been employed to develop optimal control strategies for different driving blocks, and it is helpful for realizing the adaptive energy management for real-time driving cycles. Third, to improve the real-time and robust performance of the energy management, the previous 100s duration of historical information has been determined to identify a real-time driving pattern. Finally, an adaptive energy management strategy has been proposed. The simulation results indicate that the proposed energy management strategy has better fuel efficiency than the original and conventional dynamic programming-based control strategies.

                  This study aimed to explore bending collapse behavior and energy absorption capacity of net aluminum (Al), net carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) and Al/CFRP hybrid tubes, respectively. Based upon the experimental tests, the transverse energy absorption of the Al/CFRP hybrid tubes was found to be even higher than the sum of corresponding net Al tube and net CFRP tube. Specifically, the CF-AL tube (the CFRP tube being placed outside the Al tube) increased the peak force by 6.7% and energy absorption by 20.6%. The AL-CF tube (the CFRP tube being placed inside the Al tube) improved the peak force by 14.1% and energy absorption by 19.1%. The experimental study indicated that overall, the CF-AL tube was of better crashworthiness characteristics. Subsequently, finite element (FE) analyses were carried out by correlating with the experimental results. Based upon this validated FE models, a parametric study and design optimization on the CF-AL tube (with respect to length, thickness and ply angle) were further performed. It was found that the optimization increased specific energy absorption (SEA) by 42.96% and mean crushing force by 37.75%; meanwhile the mass of optimum design decreased by 5.02%, exhibiting significant enhancement of crashworthiness characteristics.

                  The aim of this paper is to present a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) based equivalent consumption minimum strategy (ECMS) (SECMS) for fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FCHEV) powered by fuel cell, battery and supercapacitor. In order to decrease hydrogen consumption and increase the durability of power sources, fuel cell is chosen as the main power source and supplies steady current, battery is designed as the main energy buffer and the replacement of fuel cell failure and supercapacitor is operated to supply peak power. Low energy density of supercpacitor lets its equivalent hydrogen consumption be taken as zero for many ECMS researches. This simplification leads to suboptimal fuel economy and complex of control system. SECMS considers hydrogen consumption of three power sources into objective function to solve this problem. A rule based control strategy (RBCS) and an hybrid ECMS operating mode control strategy (OMCS) (HEOS) are also designed to compare with SECMS. An experimental test bench is built to validate the comparative study of three strategies. The results show that compared with RBCS and HEOS, hydrogen consumption of SECMS decreases of

                  The modeling and state-of-charge estimation of the batteries and ultracapacitors are crucial to the battery/ultracapacitor hybrid energy storage system. In recent years, the model based state estimators are welcomed widely, since they can adjust the gain according to the error between the model predictions and measurements timely. In most of the existing algorithms, the model parameters are either configured by theoretical values or identified off-line without adaption. But in fact, the model parameters always change continuously with loading wave or self-aging, and the lack of adaption will reduce the estimation accuracy significantly. To overcome this drawback, a novel co-estimator is proposed to estimate the model parameters and state-of-charge simultaneously. The extended Kalman filter is employed for parameter updating. To reduce the convergence time, the recursive least square algorithm and the off-line identification method are used to provide initial values with small deviation. The unscented Kalman filter is employed for the state-of-charge estimation. Because the unscented Kalman filter takes not only the measurement uncertainties but also the process uncertainties into account, it is robust to the noise. Experiments are executed to explore the robustness, stability and precision of the proposed method.

                  A hybrid electric vehicle has more than one energy source and switching between the two sources leads to significant drivability problem. Drivability is used to describe the comfort of driving a vehicle under a wide variety of operating conditions like tip-in, tip-out, and gear shifting. Vehicle drivability is one of the keystones of product quality and is refined aggressively to achieve product differentiation and market position. Specific aspects of drivability problems can be improved using modern control techniques. In this paper, a generic model of the driveline of a plug-in hybrid vehicle is developed. Drivability evaluation indices have been developed and were used for evaluating the drivability performance. Analysis and measurements of the actual components of this vehicle followed by parameter identification based on experimental data are used to obtain a validated version of the driveline model. A comparison of the driveline under consideration with changes in critical parameters is presented to demonstrate the effect of these parameters on drivability. The paper then focuses on improving the tip-in and tip-out drivability problem by proposing a control architecture consisting of an input shaping feedforward control filter and a feedback controller around an inner disturbance observer loop. The proposed controller is tested in both simulations and in experimental road tests and is shown to improve the drive quality of the vehicle significantly.

The paper then focuses on improving the tip-in and tip-out drivability problem by proposing a control architecture consisting of an input shaping feedforward control filter and a feedback controller around an inner disturbance observer loop. The proposed controller is tested in both simulations and in experimental road tests and is shown to improve the drive quality of the vehicle significantly.

                  Parameter-matching methods and optimal control strategies of the top-selling hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), namely, power-split HEV, are widely studied. In particular, extant research on control strategy focuses on the steady-state energy management strategy to obtain better fuel economy. However, given that multi-power sources are highly coupled in power-split HEVs and influence one another during mode shifting, conducting research on dynamic coordination control strategy (DCCS) to achieve riding comfort is also important. This paper proposes a predictive-model-based DCCS. First, the dynamic model of the objective power-split HEV is built and the mode shifting process is analyzed based on the developed model to determine the reason for the system shock generated. Engine torque estimation algorithm is then designed according to the principle of the nonlinear observer, and the prediction model of the degree of shock is established based on the theory of model predictive control. Finally, the DCCS with adaptation for a complex driving cycle is realized by combining the feedback control and the predictive model. The presented DCCS is validated on the co-simulation platform of AMESim and Simulink. Results show that the shock during mode shifting is well controlled, thereby improving riding comfort.

                  Faced with environmental issues caused by fossil fuel burning in the industrial and transportation sectors, innovations towards cleaner solutions to replace the ever diminishing fossil fuels have been the focus of not only researchers but governments all around the world. The hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) technology is the result of the desire to have vehicles with a better fuel economy and lower tailpipe emissions to meet the requirements of environmental policies as well as to absorb the impact of rising fuel prices. The objectives are met by combining a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) with one or more electric motors powered by a battery pack that can be charged using an on-board generator and the regenerative braking technology to power the transmission. The challenge is to develop an efficient energy management strategy (EMS) to satisfy the objectives while not having a reduced vehicle performance. In this paper, EMSs that are proposed and developed in the recent years are revisited and reviewed. Additionally, the Plug-in HEV is discussed in a new perspective from the EMS point of view. The through-the-road (TtR) HEV with in-wheel motors (IWM) is a fairly new concept in the HEV design that features less complicated configuration with reduced hardware requirements and lower cost. Recent research findings are evaluated throughout this paper leading to a hypothetical TtR HEV materialization. A thorough discussion is made encompassing the advantages and disadvantages of the concept, its performance compared to conventional HEVs and the way forward.

                  Detailed comparisons are made between various types of light-duty vehicles fueled with natural gas and hydrogen. Natural gas vehicles are designed as charge sustaining hybrid vehicles (HEV) and hydrogen fueled vehicles (FCV) are powered by a fuel cell. All the vehicles have a range of 400 miles between refueling stops. This paper is concerned primarily with the near-term time period in which the fuel cell technology is maturing and the hydrogen infrastructure is being constructed both with respect to refueling stations and the source of the hydrogen being distributed. Detailed computer simulations are presented for vehicle classes from compact cars to mid-size SUVs. Energy (MJ) and volume (L) of fuel storage required to meet the 400 mile range target for each vehicle using natural gas and hydrogen are compared. Costs of the vehicles simulated are projected for 2015–2030. Cost results indicate that the costs of ownership of the natural gas HEVs and the hydrogen fuel cell vehicles become close in the 2025–2030 time period. CO2 emissions from natural gas fueled hybrid and fuel cell vehicles are calculated and compared for hydrogen and electricity from natural gas. Ways in which the introduction of the natural gas fueled vehicles could be a bridge to the mass marketing of fuel cell vehicles are discussed.

                  To promote the performance of the batteries used in hybrid vehicles, an effective test profile is needed. A test profile could also improve the efficiency of battery development research efforts. This paper proposes a test profile for battery equivalence research, which can accurately simulate practical operating conditions and make inconsistency among batteries. The proposed test profile is based on practical data acquired from the hybrid Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cell buses demonstrated at the 2010 Shanghai World Expo. The control strategy of the demonstration buses is first explained, followed by presentation of maps of the acquired data. Using the maps, the practical conditions are discussed. Importantly, a “Three-Ridge” map style is proposed by analyzing the current density statistics. Additionally, a fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis of the battery current is adopted to find the conversion frequency of the current in practical conditions. Based on these analyses, a credible battery test profile for hybrid PEM fuel cell buses is proposed. Finally, an experiment verifies that the proposed test profile can simulate the practical operating conditions of a hybrid vehicle battery pack.

The battery pack is the main power source whereas the fuel cell is considered as a range extender that cannot sustain alone the vehicle traction power. In addition, the fuel cell contributes to reduce the battery pack degradation by limiting its depth-of-discharge (DoD). This energy management system is based on a two layer architecture in which the upper layer computes the anticipated end-of-trip DoD using online mass estimation. The lower layer is designed to split the driver power demand by minimizing a cost function which includes the hydrogen/electricity cost ratio. Therefore, the best trade-off between reducing battery pack degradation and using cost effective energy is provided. Furthermore, the system allows the fuel cell to operate at its maximum efficiency. Comparative study results indicate that using online mass estimation improves the overall fuel consumption efficiency whilst contributing at the same time to DoD reduction.

                  This paper develops a simple but innovative integrated optimization approach (IOA) for deriving the best solutions of component sizing and control strategies of a hybrid energy system (HES) which consists of a lithium battery and a supercapacitor module. To implement IOA, a multiple for-loop structure with a preset cost function is needed to globally calculate the best hybridization and energy management of the HES. For system hybridization, the optimal size ratio is evaluated by maximizing the HES energy stored capacity at various costs. For energy management, the optimal power distribution combined with a three-mode rule-based strategy is searched to minimize the total consumed energy. Combining above two for-loop structures and giving a time-dependent test scenario, the IOA is derived by minimizing the accumulated HES power. Simulation results show that 6% of the total HES energy can be saved in the IOA case compared with the original system in two driving cycles: ECE and UDDS, and two vehicle weights, respectively. It proves that the IOA effectively derives the maximum energy storage capacity and the minimum energy consumption of the HES at the same time.

                  A hybrid power system configuration based on proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), lion-lithium battery (LIB) and supercapacitor (SC) was designed without grid connection for the hybrid tramway. To adapt to the rapid load power change and achieve higher fuel efficiency and optimal oxygen excess ratio (OER) operation of the PEMFC power subsystem, a master-slave energy management strategy based on fuzzy logic hysteresis state machine (FuHSM) and differential power processing compensation (DPPC) was proposed for the hybrid tramway, effectively taking into consideration of the dynamic response and optimum OER tracing of the integrated PEMFC subsystem. The master FuHSM controller was utilized to grantee the optimal power coordination of the multiple power sources and the slave DPPC controller was responsible for further compensating the load power demand to enhance the dynamic performance and bus voltage stability. Furthermore, the equivalent H2 consumption minimization optimization considering characteristics of the proposed energy management strategy was realized by means of EIA-PSO algorithm to further improve the fuel economy of the overall hybrid power system. The results demonstrate that the proposed energy management strategy can guarantee the stability of the hybrid power system throughout the driving cycle. In addition, more efficient power coordination dynamics among the PEMFC, LIB and SC subsystems could be achieved without additional performance degradation of the integrated PEMFC subsystem, and the results of the comparisons with other control strategies verify that the proposed energy management strategy could achieve an increase in fuel efficiency of nearly 7% for the overall hybrid tramway. Finally, the influence of the proposed energy management strategy on the service life of the PEMFC subsystem was detailed discussed, and the performance degradation of the PEMFC subsystem was quantified so as to be integrated into the proposed energy management strategy.

                  An energy management strategy (EMS) is one of the most important issues for the efficiency and performance of a hybrid vehicular system. This paper deals with a neural network and wavelet transform based EMS proposed for a fuel cell/ultra-capacitor hybrid vehicular system. The proposed method combines the capability of wavelet transform to treat transient signals with the ability of auto-associative neural network supervisory mode control. The main originality of the paper is related with the application of neural network instead of another intelligent control method, fuzzy logic, which is presented in the recent publication of the authors, and the combination of neural network-wavelet transform approaches. Then, the effectiveness comparison of both methods considering one of the most important points in a vehicular system, fuel consumption (or hydrogen consumption), is realized. The mathematical and electrical models of the hybrid vehicular system are developed in detail and simulated using MATLAB®, Simulink® and SimPowerSystems® environments.

The effectiveness of thermal management depends on the design of the thermal management system as well as the battery chemistry, cell and pack design, vehicle system characteristics, and operating conditions. We model a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle with an air-cooled battery pack composed of cylindrical LiFePO4/graphite cells and simulate the effect of thermal management, driving conditions, regional climate, and vehicle system design on battery life. We estimate that in the absence of thermal management, aggressive driving can cut battery life by two thirds; a blended gas/electric-operation control strategy can quadruple battery life relative to an all-electric control strategy; larger battery packs can extend life by an order of magnitude relative to small packs used for all-electric operation; and batteries last 73–94% longer in mild-weather San Francisco than in hot Phoenix.

Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion oxidizes the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of the three-way catalyst (TWC), thereby removing the TWC's ability to convert NOx under lean conditions. Despite prolonged operation in HCCI mode, enabled by the electric motor, the depletion of the OSC causes significant penalties in fuel economy and the amounts of tailpipe NOx are substantial. Counter-intuitively, it is seen that decreasing the sizes of both HCCI regime and OSC results in reduced tailpipe NOx while maintaining fuel economy benefits.

                  In this research, the stratified flame ignition (SFI) hybrid combustion process was proposed to enhance the control of SI–CAI hybrid combustion and moderate the maximum pressure rise rate (PRRmax) by the combination of port fuel injection (PFI) and direct injection (DI). The effect of the stratified flame formed by different piston shapes, start of direct injection (SOI) timings and direct injection ratios (rDI
                     ) on the stoichiometric SFI hybrid combustion and heat release process was studied using the three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (3-D CFD) simulations. The spark ignited flame propagation near the spark plug and the auto-ignition heat release process of the diluted mixture were modelled in the framework of 3-Zones Extended Coherent Flame Model (ECFM3Z) by the extended coherent flame model and tabulated auto-ignition chemistry of a 4-component gasoline surrogate, respectively. The operating load of indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) 3.6bar was selected to represent a typical part-load operation. The sweep of the spark timing (ST) was performed for different pistons, SOI timings and direct injection ratios. The SFI hybrid combustion process with the same combustion phasing was investigated in details. The optimal stratified mixture pattern, characterized with the central rich mixture around spark plug and stratified lean mixture at the peripheral region, formed by the newly designed Piston A and B effectively lowers the PRRmax with a slight deterioration of IMEP. The later SOI timing advances the crank angle of 50% total heat release (CA50) and significantly reduces the PRRmax with a little deterioration of IMEP. As the direct injection ratio is increased, both the PRRmax and IMEP decrease. During the SFI hybrid heat release process, spark timing is effective to control CA50, IMEP and PRRmax regardless the piston shapes, SOI timings and direct injection ratios. However, the sensitivity of SFI hybrid combustion to the stratified mixture varies with the spark timing. The reduction of the PRRmax caused by the stratified flame enables the advance of spark timing to achieve maximum IMEP.

                  Holistic energy management of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) in smart grid environment constitutes an enormous control challenge. This paper responds to this challenge by investigating the interactions among three important control tasks, i.e., charging, on-road power management, and battery degradation mitigation, in PHEVs. Three notable original contributions distinguish our work from existing endeavors.

                  In plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), the engine temperature declines due to reduced engine load and extended engine off period. It is proven that the engine efficiency and emissions depend on the engine temperature. Also, temperature influences the vehicle air-conditioner and the cabin heater loads. Particularly, while the engine is cold, the power demand of the cabin heater needs to be provided by the batteries instead of the waste heat of engine coolant. The existing energy management strategies (EMS) of PHEVs focus on the improvement of fuel efficiency based on hot engine characteristics neglecting the effect of temperature on the engine performance and the vehicle power demand. This paper presents a new EMS incorporating an engine thermal management method which derives the global optimal battery charge depletion trajectories. A dynamic programming-based algorithm is developed to enforce the charge depletion boundaries, while optimizing a fuel consumption cost function by controlling the engine power. The optimal control problem formulates the cost function based on two state variables: battery charge and engine internal temperature. Simulation results demonstrate that temperature and the cabin heater/air-conditioner power demand can significantly influence the optimal solution for the EMS, and accordingly fuel efficiency and emissions of PHEVs.

                  Energy management strategy is crucial in improving the fuel economy of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). This paper targets at evaluating the role of velocity forecast in the adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategies (ECMS) for HEVs. A neural network based velocity predictor is constructed to forecast the short-term future driving behaviors by learning from history data. Then the velocity predictor is combined with adaptive-ECMS to provide temporary driving information for real-time equivalence factor (EF) adaptation. Compared with traditional adaptive-ECMS, which uses historical driving profile for EF estimation, the proposed strategy is able to foresee the change of the driving behaviors and adjust the EF more reasonably. Simulation results show that, compared with traditional adaptive-ECMS, the proposed improvement with velocity forecast incorporated is able to achieve better fuel economy and more stable battery state of charge (SOC) trajectory, with a fuel consumption reduction by over 3%.

The proposed method formulates a new cost function representing the analytical expression of the overall energy efficiency of the hybrid energy source (i.e. ICE/generator set+battery pack) which is calculated based on the energy flow at the DC bus. Engine operating points are determined by assessing not only the efficiency map of the engine but also the efficiency map of the generator and the charge/discharge efficiency of the battery pack in order to maximize the efficiency of the energy delivered from the hybrid energy source to the drive system. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed and demonstrated on a hybrid electric bus developed in MATLAB/Simulink for different driving cycle conditions and the results have been compared with alternative optimization methods such as equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS), model predictive control (MPC) and dynamic programming (DP) approach. The simulation results show that the proposed method provides a competitive performance with a lower computational burden compared to the alternative methods for different state of charge (SOC) ranges and drive cycle conditions.

                  It may happen that the equations governing the response of dynamical systems have some parameters whose values may not be known a priori and have to be obtained using parameter estimation schemes. In this article, we present a parameter estimation scheme for a class of sequential hybrid systems. By hybrid systems, we refer to those systems whose response is described by different governing equations corresponding to various regimes/modes of operation along with some criteria to switch between the same. In a sequential hybrid system, the different modes are arranged in a specific sequence and the system can switch from a given mode to either the previous mode or the following mode in this sequence. Here, we consider those systems whose governing equations consist of ordinary differential equations and algebraic equations. The conditions for switching between the various modes (referred to as transition conditions) are in the form of linear inequalities involving the system output. We shall first consider the case where the transition conditions are known completely. We present a parameter update scheme along with sufficient conditions that will guarantee bounded parameter estimation errors. Then, we shall consider the case where the transition conditions are not known in the sense that some parameters in these conditions are not known. We present a parameter estimation scheme for this case. We illustrate the performance of the parameter estimation scheme in both cases with some examples.

A new driveline concept with an additional flywheel makes it possible to compensate for the engine inertia in transient situations. This allows the driveline to be operated for optimal fuel economy without losing driveability. However, to realize this objective it is inevitable to control the driveline in a coordinated way. In light of the system uncertainties and the unknown load as well as nonlinearities a nonlinear robust controller is proposed to generate the setpoints for engine torque and CVT ratio. The focus is on the control law for the CVT ratio setpoint. The controlled CVT regulates the power flow from the engine and flywheel to the wheels while compensating for the internal inertias.

                  The design and test of a 9.5 kWe proton exchange membrane fuel cell passively coupled with a 33 × 1500 F supercapacitor pack is presented. Experimental results showed that the system reduced dynamic loads on the fuel cell without the need for additional DC/DC converters. Fuel efficiency gains of approximately 5% were achieved by passive hybridisation in addition to addressing two main operational degradation mechanisms: no-load idling and rapid load cycling.
                  Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy measurements indicated that the supercapacitor capacitance dropped with decreasing cell voltage and suggested that operation below 1.3 V is not recommended.

                  Hybrid electric propulsive systems (HEPSs) attract increasing research interest due to their environmental and economic merits. However, the design optimization of HEPSs with the single objective of fuel saving may result in increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and high cost. The present study proposes a multi-objective optimization method to obtain an optimal trade-off with respect to fuel consumption, GHG emission, and lifecycle cost. Due to high convergence in solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is developed to explore an optimal design space. Performance tests are conducted on a real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform. The hybrid diesel/battery/shore power system on an anchor handling tug supply vessel is considered as a study case. The results of the proposed NSGA-II are compared with those from a single-objective optimization pursuing minimum fuel consumption. The proposed method outputs designs that can significantly reduce GHG emission and lifecycle cost by sacrificing low fuel consumption when compared with that of single objective optimization. Furthermore, the HEPS designed by the proposed method exhibits advantages over the conventional propulsive system in terms of all the three aspects.

                  Three-dimensional (3-D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were used to investigate and obtain a fundamental understanding of the effect of dilution strategies and direct injection ratios on the stratified flame ignition (SFI) hybrid combustion. The combination of port fuel injection (PFI) and direct injection (DI) was used to form the homogeneous lean/diluted mixture and stratified charge respectively. Studies were carried out on effects of dilution strategies with different combinations of fuel/air equivalence ratio (ϕair
                     ) and fuel/dilution equivalence ratio (ϕdilution
                     ) with negative valve overlap (NVO). Compared to the stoichiometric SFI hybrid combustion, the air-diluted SFI hybrid combustion optimizes the early flame propagation process because of the avoidance of over-rich mixture around spark plug. In order to explore the potential of SFI hybrid combustion under a high compression ratio (14:1) operation, the lean boosted dilution strategy with additional intake air and internal residual gas was proposed to address the trade-off between indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and maximum pressure rise rate (PRRmax) in air-diluted SFI hybrid combustion. Furthermore, the effect of direct injection ratio (rDI
                     ) was investigated as a means to optimize the fuel/air equivalence ratio distribution as well as the air-diluted SFI hybrid combustion performance. It is found that the optimal SFI hybrid combustion with rDI
                      of 0.16 can be used to both achieve higher IMEP for a given amount of fuel and moderate the rate of heat release. Finally, three different combustion regimes, including pure flame propagation zone, hybrid combustion zone and pure auto-ignition zone, are proposed to understand the effect of typical fuel/air equivalence ratio distribution patterns on the air-diluted SFI hybrid combustion characteristics and performances. In order to obtain optimal hybrid combustion with high IMEP and low PRRmax, the in-cylinder stratified mixture should avoid over-rich condition around spark plug and over-lean condition at outer region. In addition, the internal residual gas in the dilution strategy should be carefully controlled to maintain sufficient thermal condition and ensure the stable auto-ignition of the lean mixture at outer region.

Compared to the stoichiometric SFI hybrid combustion, the air-diluted SFI hybrid combustion optimizes the early flame propagation process because of the avoidance of over-rich mixture around spark plug. In order to explore the potential of SFI hybrid combustion under a high compression ratio (14:1) operation, the lean boosted dilution strategy with additional intake air and internal residual gas was proposed to address the trade-off between indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and maximum pressure rise rate (PRRmax) in air-diluted SFI hybrid combustion. Furthermore, the effect of direct injection ratio (rDI
                     ) was investigated as a means to optimize the fuel/air equivalence ratio distribution as well as the air-diluted SFI hybrid combustion performance. It is found that the optimal SFI hybrid combustion with rDI
                      of 0.16 can be used to both achieve higher IMEP for a given amount of fuel and moderate the rate of heat release. Finally, three different combustion regimes, including pure flame propagation zone, hybrid combustion zone and pure auto-ignition zone, are proposed to understand the effect of typical fuel/air equivalence ratio distribution patterns on the air-diluted SFI hybrid combustion characteristics and performances. In order to obtain optimal hybrid combustion with high IMEP and low PRRmax, the in-cylinder stratified mixture should avoid over-rich condition around spark plug and over-lean condition at outer region. In addition, the internal residual gas in the dilution strategy should be carefully controlled to maintain sufficient thermal condition and ensure the stable auto-ignition of the lean mixture at outer region.

                  Based on the theories of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and aeroacoustics, a hybrid simulation technique, the so-called LES-LAA method is proposed in this paper, for predicting the wind buffeting noises generated by opening rear windows of a running vehicle. The LES-LAA is developed by combining the large eddy simulation (LES) and the Lighthill acoustic analogy (LAA) methods. Based on the established vehicle and wind tunnel models, the wind buffeting noises from rear windows are predicted by using the proposed LES-LAA method and the obtained results are compared with experimental data. The results show that the calculation error of sound pressure level (SPL) from the LES-LAA method is less than 2%, which suggests that the proposed method has good accuracy in predicting the wind noise of the rear window of a vehicle. The wind noise when both sides of the rear window are opened at the same time is much lower than the case when just one window is opened. In conclusion, the hybrid LES-LAA technique presented in this paper is effective and feasible for predicting the wind buffeting noise, which can be applied to other types of vehicle and is a promising approach for solving other aero-acoustical engineering problems.

                  Manufacturers often overlook the importance of optimizing workcell layout. Optimizing manufacturing workcell layouts can help increase production efficiency by reducing unnecessary actions and movements. However, the application of conventional optimization methods to modern production lines is not only becoming too complex, but also becoming inaccurate and unreliable. In this paper, we proposed an accurate and practical methodology that is readily implementable. The methodology uses multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) concepts to optimize manufacturing workcell layouts, specifically for the production of hybrid medical devices. The proposed model, also known as the Two-Step MOCO model, considers objectives and constraints that are selected by the manufacturer. The first step determines the optimal number of equipment and operators required given a fixed budget, while the second step determines the optimal positions for every equipment, given a fixed space and the required safety distance among each equipment, after considering the results of the first step. We illustrated the implementation of the proposed model on the fabrication of a hybrid medical device. Virtual manufacturing workcells were developed and utilized to evaluate the proposed methodology. The evaluation results proved the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model, and its ability to provide flexibility to manufacturers. This paper highlights the potential of our proposed optimization model in improving production efficiency in medical device and other manufacturing industries.

                  Car builders are facing restrictions on both fuel consumption (FC) and pollutant emissions. In this context, Diesel Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) are an interesting solution since they are more fuel-efficient than their gasoline-powered counterparts. However, Diesel pollutants remain a concern as, despite the fact that particulate emissions are treated by the Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF), tailpipe NOx emissions are still problematic. Previous works have shown that a better FC to pollutants trade-off can be achieved if the Energy and Emissions Management Strategy (EEMS) of the HEV includes the pollutants downstream an After-Treatment System (ATS). For Diesel HEV, a previous approach which took into account the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) has been applied. This paper aims to find a better trade-off by adding the Diesel Oxidation Catalyst’s (DOC) influence on the SCR’s efficiency. Consequently, three EEMS taking into account more or fewer ATS are calculated with the Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm on the Worldwide Light vehicle Test Cycle (WLTC). Hence, each strategy is applied to the full energy and emission model in order to deduce a fuel consumption to tailpipe NOx tradeoff. The tradeoffs for each strategy are compared. As a result, all the strategies can reduce NOx emissions by 30% with a FC penalty of 3%. In addition, the three EEMS have shown similar FC/tailpipe NOx trade-offs but the EEMS that took ATS into account were able to produce 3% more engine-out NOx than the strategy with no ATS. To ensure the optimality of the solutions, the impact of the states’ discretization in the DP algorithm is investigated. Despite a high discretization level for each state, the SCR’s temperature variation is still over-approximated and might underestimate the benefit of a strategy considering the complete Diesel ATS.

                  This paper describes a comparative study of two control schemes for the energy management system of a hybrid tramway powered by a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell (FC) and an Ni-MH battery. The hybrid system was designed for a real surface tramway of 400kW. It is composed of a PEM FC system with a unidirectional dc/dc boost converter (FC converter) and a rechargeable Ni-MH battery with a bidirectional dc/dc converter (battery converter), both of which are coupled to a traction dc bus. The PEM FC and Ni-MH battery models were designed from commercially available components.
                  The function of the two control architectures was to effectively distribute the power of the electrical sources. One of these control architectures was a state machine control strategy, based on eight states. The other was a cascade control strategy which was used to validate the results obtained. The simulation results for the real driving cycle of the tramway reflected the optimal performance of the control systems compared in this study.

                  A system integration of a novel proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC)-powered hybrid scooter was conducted to assess its performance. The fuel cell/lithium ion battery hybrid electric scooter system was composed of an air-cooled and self-humidified 2.3 kW PEMFC stack, a lithium ion battery, a low-pressure metal hydride canister set, a quick connector, a DC–DC converter, a hub motor, and an electronic control unit. PEMFCs have the benefit of a rapid start-up, low operating temperatures, and high power densities, making them ideal power sources for electric vehicles. Most recent fuel cell vehicle designs have used fuel cell hybrids architectures because of their enhanced fuel economy, superior performance at cold starts, ability to capture regenerative braking energy, and reduced system costs. Similarly, this study configured a lithium ion battery as the secondary energy source because of its rapid discharge capability. The PEMFC provided the scooter with a continuous electricity supply, and a 9.2 A h and 48.92–50.05 V lithium ion battery powered the scooter when a sudden burst of electric energy was required for stepping out, speeding up, or climbing. However, the hybrid system presented a unique challenge for the multiple energy sources to work together effectively. A modified ECE40 test and a USABC dynamic stress test were conducted to assess the performance of the hybrid scooter. Besides, in the dyno test, the maximum speed of the scooter was 53.2 km/h, and the distance between refueling was 63.5 km when the scooter's speed was fixed at 30 km/h. In the future, the main objectives are to extend the range, reduce the weight of the scooter, and increase the hydrogen use of the fuel cell.

                  This study proposes a novel technique to obtain the optimum size of a Solar/Wind/Battery hybrid power system (HPS) using Clonal Selection Algorithm (CLONALG). The objective of the proposed method is to find the optimal size of the HPS to utilize its output with small fluctuation rate and minimum cost. The system is designed with the optimal size of PV arrays, wind turbines, and batteries so that it can satisfy the demand requirement with the least percentage of load interruptions. Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP) is considered as a reliability index of the HPS, and the optimization process is supposed to get the least LPSP as it could. To verify the proposed algorithm, it is applied to a case study located in Troyes Barbery Station- France and the results are compared with those obtained by Genetic Algorithm (GA). Then the CLONALG is used to get the optimal size of an HPS located in Qena AL-Gadida city-Egypt. The results proved that the proposed method is effective for the sizing process and can achieve the system objectives.

These vehicles run on energy obtained from fossils fuels such as petroleum oils that pollute environment with the gases that are emitted after burning. In addition, the cost of this fuel type will increase because of decreasing reserves; therefore, these petroleum oils must be used very efficiently. Due to environmental and financial problems, the development of clear and efficient city transportation has accelerated. Hence, hybrid electrical vehicles gain significant importance because they are environmentally friendly and efficient in fuel usage. In this study, a conventional commercial vehicle was chosen for design to a mixed hybrid systems.

                  Due to increasing concerns on environmental pollution and depleting fossil fuels, fuel cell (FC) vehicle technology has received considerable attention as an alternative to the conventional vehicular systems. However, a FC system combined with an energy storage system (ESS) can display a preferable performance for vehicle propulsion. As the additional ESS can fulfill the transient power demand fluctuations, the fuel cell can be downsized to fit the average power demand without facing peak loads. Besides, braking energy can be recovered by the ESS. This study focuses on a vehicular system powered by a fuel cell and equipped with two secondary energy storage devices: battery and ultra-capacitor (UC). However, an advanced energy management strategy is quite necessary to split the power demand of a vehicle in a suitable way for the on-board power sources in order to maximize the performance while promoting the fuel economy and endurance of hybrid system components. In this study, a wavelet and fuzzy logic based energy management strategy is proposed for the developed hybrid vehicular system. Wavelet transform has great capability for analyzing signals consisting of instantaneous changes like a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) power demand. Besides, fuzzy logic has a quite suitable structure for the control of hybrid systems.

                  The challenges encountered in the development of a predictive energy management strategy (EMS) for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) include improving the vehicle speed prediction accuracy and resolving the contradiction between the real-time performance and optimality. Connected vehicles provide possible vehicle speed prediction accuracy improvements, further optimizing the EMS. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel predictive EMS for connected vehicles. Based on traffic information, the vehicle speed trajectory is predicted according to driver's intention inference and prediction models for each intention. Since the A* algorithm can quickly find the shortest path in the road network under the guidance of the distance from the goal, this algorithm is introduced to search for the optimal EMS within the prediction horizon under the guidance of a proposed heuristic function. Then, the searched EMS is fused with an offline-optimized strategy to improve the real-time performance. Taking a 48 V HEV as an example, the predictive EMS is simulated using traffic data generated by traffic simulation software, and the fuel economy is only 1.16% lower than that under the global optimal strategy. Finally, hardware-in-the-loop tests are performed to verify the real-time performance.

                  The benefit of telemetry systems that can provide information about future traffic conditions has been previously established, with both vehicle velocity and torque split controllers in hybrid vehicles able to improve fuel economy and emissions. However, many existing algorithms are either computationally intractable for real application or do not maximise the potential savings available. Here, a computationally efficient approach for the optimal control of both velocity and torque split of a parallel hybrid electric vehicle with vehicle telemetry is proposed. The optimal control inputs are determined using Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle and applied in a receding horizon fashion over realistic drive cycles. Although developed on a relatively simple model, the proposed controller is tested on a complex hybrid vehicle simulation. The effectiveness of the proposed controller in improving fuel consumption is investigated as preview information is varied, and in the presence of modelling error and measurement noise.

                  Besides a brief review of the issues and the challenges related to the real-time optimization (RTO) strategies for the Fuel Cell Hybrid Power Sources (FCHPS), a new RTO strategy is proposed and analyzed here to find the optimal values of both fueling flow rates for the FCHPS under a dynamic load cycle. The optimization strategy to search and track the optimal value is based on the Global Extremum Seeking (GES) algorithm. In comparison with the Static Feed-Forward (sFF) RTO strategy, where both fueling rates are controlled by the FC current, the GES-RTO strategy adjusts the FC current with values given by two GES control schemes. Thus, the fueling regulators are controlled by two reference currents which are a bit different to FC current. The performance obtained with the GES-RTO strategy proposed herein is shown in comparison with the sFF-RTO strategy for constant load, but also for dynamic load profile. In last case both strategies will use a Load-Following (LF) control for the boost converter that interfaces the FC system with the DC bus. The performance will be estimated considering the following indicators: the generated FC net power, the fuel consumption efficiency, the FC system efficiency, and the total fuel consumption during a load cycle. The fuel economy for 6 kW FC system during a nominal load cycle of 60 s could be up to 40 l if the GES-RTO strategy is used instead of the sFF-RTO strategy.

                  This paper describes the outcomes of a study carried out on a novel exhaust energy recovery system for a heavily downsized gasoline engine. The investigation was carried out based on a 1.0 L turbocharged gasoline engine offering the same performance as a 2.0 L model, with the aim of reducing CO2 emissions from 169 g/km to 99 g/km. This is to be obtained by the synergistic application of electrified boosting, stop/start technology, regenerative braking, torque assist and exhaust energy recovery systems.
                  The research focussed on the design of a high performance LPT (Low Pressure Turbine) to recover latent energy left in the exhaust gas after expanding in the main turbocharger turbine. The LPT is meant to be coupled to an electric generator whose combination is usually referred as electric turbocompounding. Given the small engine size and therefore the low mass flow rate of the exhaust gas, the design operating conditions were fixed at 50,000 rpm with an optimum pressure ratio of PR ≈ 1.1. Commercially available turbines are not suitable for this purpose due to the very low efficiencies (less than 40%) experienced when operating in such low pressure ratios range. The design was accomplished by following a number of steps which go from meanline loss model development, full 3-D CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) analysis (using ANSYS CFX), prototype manufacturing and steady-state testing. The test results, that were conducted by using the Imperial College London cold-flow test facility, showed good agreement with CFD analysis with an efficiency greater than 70%.
                  The steady maps obtained from testing were then input into a 1-D engine model including the electric turbocompounding. Three different arrangements were considered for the turbocompounding: (1) pre-catalyst, (2) post-catalyst and (3) in the wastegate of the main turbocharger. Two different scenarios were investigated in which the extra energy recovered by the turbocompounding unit is either fully regenerated into the engine crankshaft or stored and not re-used. The BSFC (brake specific fuel consumption) and the BMEP (brake mean effective pressure) were calculated and compared with the baseline engine under full and part load conditions. At full load, the analysis was performed for several engine speeds (from 1000 rpm to 6000 rpm at steps of 500 rpm each). The results showed that the extra energy recovered by the turbocompounding device is offering a significant benefit on engine performance; the post-catalyst solution offers the best compromise in terms of BSFC and BMEP with an improvement of 2.41% and 2.21% respectively. At part load engine instead, the analysis was performed for three engine speeds (1500 rpm, 2000 rpm and 4000 rpm) for the post-catalyst position only. Despite the increment in pumping work due to the presence of the LPT, no significant penalty in BSFC was calculated when no energy is returned into the engine whereas an improvement of ≈2.64% was found in the other case.

                  As one of the main working modes, the energy recovered with regenerative braking system provides an effective approach so as to greatly improve fuel economy of hybrid electric bus. However, it is still a challenging issue to ensure braking stability while maximizing braking energy recovery. To solve this problem, an efficient energy recovery control strategy is proposed based on the modified nonlinear model predictive control method. Firstly, combined with the characteristics of the compound braking process of single-shaft parallel hybrid electric bus, a 7 degrees of freedom model of the vehicle longitudinal dynamics is built. Secondly, considering nonlinear characteristic of the vehicle model and the efficiency of regenerative braking system, the particle swarm optimization algorithm within the modified nonlinear model predictive control is adopted to optimize the torque distribution between regenerative braking system and pneumatic braking system at the wheels. So as to reduce the computational time of modified nonlinear model predictive control, a nearest point method is employed during the braking process. Finally, the simulation and hardware-in-loop test are carried out on road conditions with different tire–road adhesion coefficients, and the proposed control strategy is verified by comparing it with the conventional control method employed in the baseline vehicle controller. The simulation and hardware-in-loop test results show that the proposed strategy can ensure vehicle safety during emergency braking situation and improve the recovery energy almost 17% compared with the conventional rule-based strategy in the general braking situation. Therefore, the proposed control strategy might offer a theoretical reference for the design of the actual braking controller in engineering practice.

The average cell voltage decline rate is approximately 346 μV/h at a current density of 120 A, under which the initial voltage is about 0.7 V. The estimated lifetime in the third stage reaches the design target. The final electrochemically active surface areas are approximately 80% of the initial value. A detailed degradation analysis of fuel cell voltage uniformity is presented, and a five-region degradation otherness analysis is proposed for performance uniformity analysis.

                  Flywheel energy storage devices may be coupled to mechanical transmissions for braking energy recovery and the provision of additional power for acceleration in hybrid vehicles. Power transmission across a continuous range of speed ratios is necessary. The flywheel size and depth-of-discharge must be chosen for a particular application, and this has a direct effect on transmission efficiency, required gearing ratios and mass of components. Optimisation of these parameters requires a fundamental understanding of this interaction, which has not previously been investigated and reported. To address this, the current paper presents a new method of analysing mechanical flywheel systems. A simple algebraic analysis can be used to specify flywheel system parameters for any regenerative braking application where the flywheel is used to provide initial acceleration of the vehicle from stationary. This has been applied to systems using geared transmissions with continuous speed variation achieved through sliding contact in clutch and brake components. The results of the analysis highlight how the optimum selection of flywheel depth-of-discharge must achieve a balance between high transmission efficiency and low system mass. This is illustrated for a passenger car application, allowing a full assessment of system performance and the specification of appropriate design parameters.

                  Diesel power systems are one of the schemes for energy supply generation. However, they are mostly associated with difficulties of emission control and cost of the maintenance on top of the diesel fuel cost. Some of these problems can be reduced by incorporating renewable energy such as wind turbines and solar PV along with the existing diesel station. Hybrid systems provide clean and reliable power supply, and can be more cost-effective than sole diesel systems. This paper assesses the feasibility of expanding an existing diesel power plant into a hybrid power system (HPS) using Power Pinch Analysis (PoPA). A HPS configuration developed using PoPA methodology can provide close-to-optimal solar and wind electricity supplies while minimising the diesel generation. Results show that a HPS that combines solar and wind system with diesel power generation can provide significant diesel fuel savings while satisfying the demands at a reasonable cost.

                  The control of the transmission system in vehicles is significant for the driving comfort. In order to design a controller for smooth shifting and comfortable driving, a dynamic model of a dual-clutch transmission is presented in this paper. A finite-time linear quadratic regulator is proposed for the optimal control of the two friction clutches in the torque phase for the upshift process. An integral linear quadratic regulator is introduced to regulate the relative speed difference between the engine and the slipping clutch under the optimization of the input torque during the inertia phase. The control objective focuses on smoothing the upshift process so as to improve the driving comfort. Considering the available sensors in vehicles for feedback control, an observer design is presented to track the immeasurable variables. Simulation results show that the jerk can be reduced both in the torque phase and inertia phase, indicating good shift performance. Furthermore, compared with conventional controllers for the upshift process, the proposed control method can reduce shift jerk and improve shift quality.

For switching systems with minimum and maximum dwell times and controlled resets, we are able to derive digital control strategies with guaranteed properties that ensure safety.

In our modeling approach, we do not assume synchronization between sampling time and switching time.

We assess the cost-effectiveness of increased battery capacity vs. nondomestic charging infrastructure installation for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles as alternate methods to reduce gasoline consumption for cars, trucks, and SUVs in the US. We find across a wide range of scenarios that the least-cost solution is for more drivers to switch to low-capacity plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (short electric range with gasoline backup for long trips) or gasoline-powered hybrid electric vehicles. If more gasoline savings are needed per vehicle, nondomestic charging infrastructure installation is substantially more expensive than increased battery capacity per gallon saved, and both approaches have higher costs than US oil premium estimates. Cost effectiveness of all subsidies are lower under a binding fuel economy standard. Comparison of results to the structure of current federal subsidies shows that policy is not aligned with fuel savings potential, and we discuss issues and alternatives.

                  This paper utilizes the dynamic programming (DP) approach to deal with the integrated optimization problem for deriving the best configuration and energy split strategies of a hybrid energy storage system (HESS), including a battery and a supercapacitor (SC), for an electric city bus. Within the optimization process, a preset cost function is employed to evaluate the HESS life cycle cost based on a dynamic degradation model of the LiFePO4 battery, which is initially proposed by us. For system hybridization, the battery size is optimized according to the requested minimal mileage, while the optimal configuration of the SC pack (i.e., the numbers of the SC modules in series and parallel) is determined using the DP approach. It is shown that the life cycle cost of the HESS initially decreases rapidly with the addition of SCs, though the rate of this reduction decreases as the amount of SC increases. The HESS candidates occurring in the transition area can therefore be regarded as the best solutions. For the energy split strategy, several control rules can be extracted from the DP results, and a near-optimal rule-based strategy is proposed in this paper. When compared to the battery-only configuration, the HESS controlled by the rule-based strategy can reduce 47% and 60% of the ESS life cycle cost along the typical China Bus Driving Cycle and the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule, respectively. This paper also proves that a well-tuned rule-based strategy, which can be easily implemented in a vehicle, presents rather good performance when compared to the DP approach. In addition, the proposed strategy performance can be further improved by increasing the SC usage.

                  Aiming at reducing both size and losses of energy saving system and also integrating the system’s output current and voltage, this paper proposed a new energy management strategy using novel controller in application of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The proposed controller, called hybrid sliding mode controller (HSMC), significantly improves the transient response and disturbance rejection of the two input bidirectional converters (TIBCs), while preserving the closed loop stability. The combination of the SMC and invasive weed optimization (IWO), realizes a fast transient response over a wide transient load changes and input voltage disturbances. The development of TIBC modelling based on state space averaging technique has been discussed. Practical and simulation results are reported to validate the theoretical predictions and to confirm the superior performance of the proposed nonlinear controller when it is compared with a traditional SMC. Finally the performance of manufactured EV which equipped with proposed controller was investigated through practical test in case of the stochastic EV driving cycle.

                  The hybridization of the fuel-cell electric-vehicle (FCEV) by a second energy source has the advantage of improving the system's dynamic response and efficiency. Indeed, an ultra-capacitor (UC) system used as an energy storage device fulfills the FC slowest dynamics during fast power transitions and recovers the braking energy. In FC/UC hybrid vehicles, the search for a suitable power management approach is one of the main objectives. In this paper, an improved control strategy managing the active power distribution between the two energy sources is proposed. The UC reference power is calculated through the DC link voltage regulation. For the FC power demand, an algorithm with five operating modes is developed. This algorithm, depending on the UC state of charge (SOC) and the vehicle speed level, minimizes the FC power demand transitions and therefore ameliorates its durability. The traction power is provided using two permanent magnetic synchronous motor-wheels to free more space in the vehicle. The models of the FC/UC vehicle system parts and the control strategy are developed using MATLAB software. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed energy management strategy.

                  This paper proposes a methodology and approach to understand battery performance and life through driving cycle and duty cycle analyses from electric and hybrid vehicle (EHV) operation in real-world situations. Conducting driving cycle analysis with trip data collected from EHV operation in real life is very difficult and challenging. In fact, no comprehensive approach has been accepted to date, except those using standard driving cycles on a dynamometer or a track. Similarly, analyzing duty cycle performance of a battery under real-life operation faces the same challenge. A successful driving cycle analysis, however, can significantly enhance our understanding of EHV performance in real-life driving. Likewise, we also expect similar results through duty cycle analysis for batteries. Since 1995, we have been developing tools to analyze EHV and power source performance. In particular, we were able to collect data from a fleet of 15 Hyundai Santa Fe electric sports utility vehicles (e-SUVs) operated on Oahu, Hawaii; from July 2001 to June 2003 to allow driving and duty cycle analyses in order to understand battery pack performance from a variety of EHV operating conditions. We thus developed a comprehensive approach that comprises fuzzy logic pattern recognition (FL-PR) techniques to perform driving and duty cycle analyses. This approach has been successfully applied to EHV performance analysis via the creation of a compositional driving profile called “driving cycle profile” (DrCP) for each trip. The same approach was used to analyze battery performance via the construction of “duty cycle profile” (DuCP) to express battery usage under various operating conditions. The combination of the two analyses enables us to understand both the usage profile of EHV and battery performance in synergetic details and in a systematic manner using a pattern recognition technique.

                  Today’s automotive industry is faced with the challenge of increasing the energy efficiency of passenger cars to meet ever tightening emissions regulations. An approach to overcome these challenges is the electrification of auxiliary units of the vehicle, such as the pump drive of a hydraulic servo-system for clutch actuation in automatic transmissions (AT) or dedicated hybrid transmissions (DHT). In this context, the model-based derivation of a nonlinear feedforward control law by application of input–output linearization to a non-flat system, is presented. The underlying model, which shows switching behaviour, is derived by simplification of a physical model of the investigated hydraulic servo-system with switching properties. The control objective consists in providing the required system pressure and volume flow for fast and accurate clutch actuation through operation of several servo-valves and an electric pump drive without using a hydraulic accumulator. In this context, planning of feasible trajectories is discussed for the investigated numerically and physically stiff multi-input multi-output system (MIMO). Additionally, a nonlinear two-degree-of-freedom control concept is designed by extension of the derived nonlinear feedforward controller with a PID feedback loop. The presented control schemes for trajectory tracking are examined in simulation and validated on testbed using real hydraulic hardware.

                  Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) technology is receiving attention as an approach to reducing US dependency on foreign oil and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transportation sector. PHEVs require large batteries for energy storage, which affect vehicle cost, weight, and performance. We construct PHEV simulation models to account for the effects of additional batteries on fuel consumption, cost, and GHG emissions over a range of charging frequencies (distance traveled between charges). We find that when charged frequently, every 20miles or less, using average US electricity, small-capacity PHEVs are less expensive and release fewer GHGs than hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) or conventional vehicles. For moderate charging intervals of 20–100miles, PHEVs release fewer GHGs, but HEVs have lower lifetime costs. High fuel prices, low-cost batteries, or high carbon taxes combined with low-carbon electricity generation would make small-capacity PHEVs cost competitive for a wide range of drivers. In contrast, increased battery specific energy or carbon taxes without decarbonization of the electricity grid would have limited impact. Large-capacity PHEVs sized for 40 or more miles of electric-only travel do not offer the lowest lifetime cost in any scenario, although they could minimize GHG emissions for some drivers and provide potential to shift air pollutant emissions away from population centers. The tradeoffs identified in this analysis can provide a space for vehicle manufacturers, policymakers, and the public to identify optimal decisions for PHEV design, policy and use. Given the alignment of economic, environmental, and national security objectives, policies aimed at putting PHEVs on the road will likely be most effective if they focus on adoption of small-capacity PHEVs by urban drivers who can charge frequently.

                  We develop a hybrid cost model for the determination of unit standard costs in the Italian local public bus transport sector. Detailed economic and transport data have been collected from companies producing more than 500 million of bus-kilometers in Italy observed in 2011. We draw upon the Bottom-Up approach for the estimation of the cost of the driving personnel and the economic cost of the rolling stock which usually cover more than 50% of the total economic cost. We thus adjust for efficiency the number of bus-kilometers per vehicle and the number of net driving hours per driver, which are characterized by very different levels of efficiency across Italian Regions. We resort to the Top-Down approach for the estimation of other costs. We find that an increase in the number of net driving hours per driver produces higher savings in urban services than intercity services. Conversely, the impact of an increase in the number of bus-kilometers per vehicle in the case of urban services is almost equal to that in the case of intercity services. The applied model allows us to tune the required level of efficiency according to regional desiderata. Our results might then be useful in order to define the maximum economic compensation that can be required by any local public transport firm which takes part in competitive tendering procedures for the allotment of service concessions or which is entitled with monopoly rights by political choice and/or local public ownership.

                  The cost of Ni–MH and Li-ion battery packs is cut considerably for applications in HEV and pHEV onboard energy storage. The operational lifetime of these battery packs is still a cost concern for end users and limits long distance applications. The battery storage devices currently dominate onboard energy storage fields via slow electrochemical reactions. The battery pack experiences an extra burden when absorbing bursts of energy or releasing the required energy to facilitate quick acceleration. The dynamic operation under thermal and mechanical stresses especially during severe weather conditions has adverse effects on the battery operating life due to chemical compounds and electrode materials degradation. To overcome these limitations, an ultracapacitor can quickly polarize electrolyte solutions and accumulate energy via rapid electrostatic charges at the electrode–electrolyte interface. The ultracapacitor combines advantages including long cycle life and high power density of a conventional capacitor with enhanced energy storage capability due to high electrode surface area and low internal resistance. A hybrid ultracapacitor can be designed by using both a double-layer capacitor electrode and a battery electrode. This hybrid structure increases energy conservation and capacitance. It is also recognized as an asymmetric ultracapacitor. A power module consisting of 10 asymmetric ultracapacitors with 300F at an operating window from 4.0V to 14.5V was tested for studying of these unique features. These 10 electrochemical capacitors were connected in series and performed electrical characterizations including Ragone plots, self-discharge, features at high current loads, working voltage, and related energy storage performance. The ultracapacitor module was then operated together with a Pb–acid battery as a hybrid power device. Performance of the hybrid power system was characterized by using an adjusted cold cranking and a modified hybrid pulse power profile. The irreplaceable structures on energy storage and power delivery serve as a potential to further reduce the cyclic burden and thermal stress in advanced battery packs for onboard energy storage applications.

                  This paper presents a model predictive power management strategy for a novel anti-idling system, regenerative auxiliary power system (RAPS), designed for service vehicles. RAPS is able to utilize recovered braking energy for electrified auxiliary systems; this feature distinguishes it from its counterparts - auxiliary power unit (APU) and auxiliary battery powered unit (ABP). To efficiently operate the RAPS, a power management strategy is required to coordinate power flow between different energy sources. Thus, a model predictive controller (MPC) is developed to improve the overall efficiency of the RAPS. As an optimization-based approach, the MPC-based power management strategy usually requires the drive cycle or the drivers’ command to be known a priori. However, in this study, an average concept based MPC is developed without such knowledge. MPC parameters are tuned over an urban drive cycle; whereas, the robustness of this MPC is tested under different drive cycles (e.g. highway and combined). Analysis shows that, the presented MPC has a comparable performance as the prescient MPC regarding fuel consumption, which assumes knows the drive cycle beforehand. Meanwhile, with the help of the proposed MPC and RAPS, the service vehicle saves up to 9% of the total fuel consumption. The proposed MPC is independent of powertrain topology such that it can be directly extended to other types of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and it provides a way to apply the MPC even though future driving information is unavailable.

MPC parameters are tuned over an urban drive cycle; whereas, the robustness of this MPC is tested under different drive cycles (e.g. highway and combined). Analysis shows that, the presented MPC has a comparable performance as the prescient MPC regarding fuel consumption, which assumes knows the drive cycle beforehand. Meanwhile, with the help of the proposed MPC and RAPS, the service vehicle saves up to 9% of the total fuel consumption. The proposed MPC is independent of powertrain topology such that it can be directly extended to other types of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and it provides a way to apply the MPC even though future driving information is unavailable.

                  This paper introduces a new low-cost hybrid drivetrain concept based on compressed air energy storage. In contrast to most contemporary approaches to pneumatic hybridization, which require modification to the primary power plant, this concept is based on a stand-alone pneumatic system that could be readily integrated with existing vehicles. The pneumatic system consists of an air tank and a compressor–expander that is coupled to the rest of the drivetrain via an infinitely variable transmission. Rather than incorporating more expensive technologies such as variable valve timing or a variable compression ratio compressor, a fixed valve system consisting of a rotary valve and passive check valves is optimized to operate efficiently over a range of tank pressures. The feasibility of this approach is established by thermodynamic modeling and the construction of a proof-of-concept prototype, which is also used to fine tune model parameters. While the proof-of-concept system shows a round trip efficiency of just under 10%, modeling shows that a round trip efficiency of 26% is possible with a revised design. If waste heat from the engine is used to maintain an elevated tank temperature, efficiencies of nearly 50% may be possible, indicating that the concept could be effective for practical hybridization of passenger vehicles.

                  Energy flows and energy conversion efficiencies of commercial plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles (PHEV) are analyzed for parallel and series PHEV topologies. The analysis is performed by a combined analytical and simulation approach. Combined approach enables evaluation of energy losses on different energy paths and provides their impact on the energy consumption of the PHEV. Thereby the paper reveals energy conversion phenomena of different PHEV topologies operating according to charge depleting and charge sustaining modes as well as according to different test cycles. It is shown in the paper that amount of the energy depleted from both on-board energy sources is significantly influenced by the efficiencies of energy conversion chains from on-board energy sources to the wheels. It is also shown that energy used to power the PHEV according to particular test cycles varies based on its operating mode, which influences energy flows on different energy paths within the PHEVs and consequently overall energy consumed by the PHEV. The paper additionally discusses well-to-wheel efficiencies considering different realistic well-to-tank scenarios. It is shown that well-to-tank efficiency of electric energy generation significantly influences optimal operating mode of the PHEV if consumption of primary energy sources is considered.

                  To realize the optimal energy allocation between the engine-generator and battery of a hybrid tracked vehicle (HTV), a reinforcement learning-based real-time energy-management strategy was proposed. A systematic control-oriented model for the HTV was built and validated through the test bench, including the battery pack, the engine-generator set (EGS), and the power request. To use effectively the statistical information of power request online, a Markov chain-based real-time power request recursive algorithm for learning transition probabilities was derived and validated. The Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence rate was adopted to determine when the transition probability matrix and the optimal control strategy update in real time. Reinforcement learning (RL) was applied to compare quantitatively the effects of different forgetting factors and KL divergence rates on reducing fuel consumption. RL has also been used to optimize the control strategy for HTV, compared to preliminary and dynamic programming-based control strategies. The real-time and robust performance of the proposed online energy management strategy was verified under two driving schedules collected in the field test. The simulation results indicate the proposed RL-based energy management strategy can significantly improve fuel efficiency and can be applied in real time.

                  This paper presents the study and experimental validation of a 9kW lead-acid battery charger used to feed the 72V DC-Bus inside a hybrid electric locomotive demonstrator realized in the frame of the French research project PLATHEE (energy-efficient and environmentally friendly train platform). The role of the converter is to supply the 72V DC consumers and charge the battery. The proposed topology for the battery charger is a DC/AC/DC step-down converter structure using high frequency transformer and double resonant series-parallel dipole. Main advantages of this topology are losses minimization due to soft switching operation, reduction of passive component weight and easy system integration. However, development and testing of the converter remain complex owing to high frequency constraints. Anti-parallel diodes of DC/AC half-bridge dissipate losses in excess during switching sequences and their reverse recovery energy leads to constraining high current peaks. A solution consists in using fast Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT)/diode technology well suited to high frequency switching, and able to limit diode peak-current amplitude during switch-off. Electro-thermal endurance tests have been performed in order to characterize the thermal behavior of the semiconductor module and control its case temperature raising. The battery charger working has been first validated on laboratory test-bench using a battery emulator, and then implemented in the hybrid locomotive for electrical couplings tests.

                  The hybrid energy storage system (HESS) in electric vehicle (EV) requires power allocation for optimal performance. Recent researches show that the Markov decision process (MDP) provides promising characteristics for the energy management. However, the power fluctuation, which is rarely considered, can significantly affect the performance of HESS. The paper adopts the bilinear interpolation to smooth the MDP-based strategy. In this way, the power fluctuation can be mitigated, meanwhile the computation cost is not greatly increased. Given the battery and the ultracapacitor, two types of DC/DC converters are employed and the model of the HESS including the battery capacity degradation is introduced. Considering the energy loss and the energy reserve in the HESS, the reward function is built. Utilizing the cumulative reward function, the effect of ultracapacitor pack size on the performance of power allocation is analyzed in detail, the appropriate ultracapacitor size can be obtained further. Simulation results show that MDP strategy with the bilinear interpolation can not only reduce the energy loss by 5–10%, but also prolong the battery cycle life. Finally, the experimental workbench is built. The master-slave strategy is utilized to achieve the power allocation and DC/DC converter control. The proposed strategy is verified by the experimental results.

                  Autonomous vehicles could bring a significant benefit in terms of fuel consumption and emissions, besides safety and comfort, but the full potential can only be exploited if the appropriate (optimal) control is applied. However complexity of optimal control can prevent its use in practice. Therefore, we suggest to approximate the optimal vehicle control problem by a two-layer structure in which the upper level provides a solution for the reference speed trajectory using energy consumption as cost function, while the lower one optimally tracks the reference speed considering fuel consumption and emissions. The key advantage is the simplicity of the upper layer, which reduces the computational burden, albeit with some expected loss of optimality if compared to the global optimum. The control and results are shown using a model of a production vehicle with a CI engine. The possibility of using this approach to trade-off fuel vs. NOx is discussed.

                  This paper proposes a novel control strategy for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV). The minimization of the utility factor weighted fuel consumption (FC
                        UFW
                     ), which represents the average fuel consumption in numerous trips, is firstly proposed as the objective of the energy management. In previous studies, the trip length is usually assumed to be known. Then, if it is shorter than the all-electric range (AER), a Charge Depleting–Charge Sustaining (CDCS) strategy leads to the minimum fuel consumption; otherwise, a blended strategy that spends down battery energy almost uniformly brings the minimum fuel consumption. Nevertheless, the trip length is not always known before trip in real life. To deal with the cases of unknown trip length, this paper proposes a Range ADaptive Optimal Control (RADOC) strategy to minimize the FC

                     , which utilizes the statistical information of the trip length. The RADOC strategy was verified by dynamic programming and was found to be somewhere in between the blended and CDCS strategies. Depending on the nature of the trips, the RADOC strategy was found to improve FC

                      between 0.10% and 4.07% compared with the CDCS strategy. The RADOC strategy is very close to the CDCS strategy when the PHEV is used in regular daily driving. On the contrary, the RADOC solution exhibits a “uniform battery discharging” behavior similar to the blended strategy for urban utility vehicles or taxis.

Unlike other fuel cell bus programs, the University of Delaware's FCHB design features a battery-heavy hybrid which offers multiple advantages in terms of cost, performance and durability. The current fuel cell hybrid bus is driven on a regular transit route at the University of Delaware. The paper describes the baseline specifications of the bus with a focus on the fuel cell and the balance of plant. The fuel cell/battery series-hybrid design is well suited for urban transit routes and provides key operational advantages such as hydrogen fuel economy, efficient use of the fuel cell for battery recharging, and regenerative braking. The bus is equipped with a variety of sensors including a custom-designed cell voltage monitoring system which provide a good understanding of bus performance under normal operation. Real-time data collection and analysis have yielded key insights for fuel cell bus design optimization. Results presented here illustrate the complex flow of energy within the various subsystems of the fuel cell hybrid bus. A description of maintenance events has been included to highlight the issues that arise during general operation. The paper also describes several modifications that will facilitate design improvements in future versions of the bus. Overall, the fuel cell hybrid bus demonstrates the viability of fuel cells for urban transit applications in real world conditions.

                  The structural epoxy foam Terocore® and round tubes of different aluminium alloys (AA6060 T5, AA6061 T6 and AA7075 T6) were used to make the hybrid (foam-filled) structure. Terocore® foam was sandwiched between two concentric tubes, where the inner tube was acted as a carrier for the foam. Quasi-static three-point bending was carried out on empty (hollow) and hybrid structures to characterise the performance. In addition, the lowest generator (bottom surface) displacement and lateral (side) displacement of the structures were measured using two linear potentiometers to investigate the differences in structural deformation.
                  The performance and deformation of hybrid structures were changed with percentage volume of Terocore® foam relative to the total volume of the structure and tube wall thickness. In addition, material properties such as yield stress, elastic modulus and work hardening behaviour of the tubes are very important when optimising the performance of the hybrid structure. Two failure modes were observed in this study. Top surface failure (compression) from structures made of AA7075 T6 and bottom surface failure (tensile) from structures with higher percentage volume of foam. It was also found 55% as the optimum percentage volume of foam to prevent bottom surface failure, while maximizing the performance under current experimental conditions.
                  Finite element analysis was carried out using LS-DYNA. A number of standard mechanical tests were performed to characterise the material properties. Input parameters for failure criterion based on effective strain and volumetric strain were determined from inverse finite element analysis of tube lateral compression and full section tube tensile testing. Simulations were in very good agreement with experimental findings including successful prediction of the failure. The verified model was then used to optimise the tube dimensions and percentage volume of foam filling in order to maximise the performance of hybrid structure. It was calculated that the tube dimensions and percentage volume of Terocore® foam could be optimised to match the required performance in terms of energy absorption, while reducing the weight.

                  This paper addresses the energy management strategy (EMS) for a fuel cell hybrid electric vehicle (FC-HEV). The purpose of this paper is to ensure an optimal power splitting between the fuel cell system (FCS) and the battery pack, taking into account the operating conditions of the FCS. The FCS is a multi-physics system, and consequently, its energetic performances depend on the operating conditions (i.e., temperature, gas relative humidity, gas stoichiometry, pressure and ageing). Specific techniques must be used to reach the best performances of the FCS. In this work, models are identified online by using the adaptive recursive least square (ARLS) method to seek a variation in the FCS performances. Then, an optimization algorithm is used on the updated model to find the best efficiency and power operating points. This process is used into an optimal EMS based on Pontryagin’s minimum principle, for a FC-HEV. The effectiveness of the proposed EMS is demonstrated by conducting studies on two FCSs with different levels of degradation.

                  In this contribution, the short-time high-current behavior of electrical interconnects (through-metalized vias) manufactured in thick-film technology is investigated. Such vias are reliable devices for small currents, but their behavior when high currents are applied for short times has not been fully understood. Therefore, in a four-wire-setup, short-time high-current pulses were applied to single vias and the resulting transient voltage drops were measured. Furthermore, an FEM-model was developed to simulate this voltage drops as well as the time-dependent temperature distributions inside of the vias. Input parameters were material properties and sample geometries. The good agreement between the measured and the simulated time-dependent voltage drops validated the model. The resulting temperature distributions are an appropriate engineering tool for the further development of vias with respect to reliability and high ampacity.

Despite growing interest in its use, little guidance exists for modellers regarding the nature and variety of hybrid simulation models.

                  To efficiently operate electromechanical systems powered by two energy sources, it is necessary to determine the instantaneous power split between sources in order to minimize the energy consumption of the whole system. In this work, this problem is posed as a nonlinear finite horizon optimal control problem with control and state constraints and is solved using a direct transcription approach. The problem is fully discretized in time and the resulting finite dimensional optimization problem is solved using a nonlinear programming code. This paper describes the application of direct transcription to the case of the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) being developed in the Applied Electronics Group (GEA) at the University of Río Cuarto. The statement and discretization of the control problem, the setting for using the nonlinear programming code and several examples and comparisons with those obtained by other approaches are described.

                  Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are new alternatives that meet the efforts to develop more sustainable means of transportation and decreasing oil dependence. However, this trend could bring negative consequences to electric power systems, such as limits violations, power losses increasing, harmonics, and thermal limits violation on distribution transformers and conductors. To cope with some of those problems, this paper proposes a recharging process with the help of Artificial Immune Systems, so the voltage level in all buses is kept within the operational limits and no overload is observed. For this sake, besides distributing the load along the recharging period, capacitors installation to decrease electric losses and improve voltage levels during vehicles recharging is also considered. The results obtained render the proposed methodology as effective. Two IEEE sample systems are used to test the idea, so the results may be reproduced for research purposes.

                  This paper proposes the design and control of a fuel-cell powered wheelchair. Electric wheelchairs can improve moving ability for people with walking problems. However, their traveling distances are limited by the capacity of their batteries. We designed a fuel-cell powered electric wheelchair that can be continuously operated, thereby extending the moving range. The system consisted of three subsystems: a commercial electric wheelchair, a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), and two secondary battery sets. The study was carried out in three parts, investigating the fuel-cell control, power management, and system integration. First, we designed multivariable robust controllers for a 500 W PEMFC system to charge the battery sets by constant voltage/current. Second, we designed a serial power management system, where the wheelchair motors were directly driven by the secondary battery sets, which in turn were charged by the PEMFC when their capacities dropped below a certain level. Lastly, we integrated the three subsystems and verified the system performance by experiments. The results confirmed the effectiveness of the PEMFC system as a way to extend the traveling distance of a motorized wheelchair.

Except obtaining the optimal control, the paper also shows how convex optimization can be used to simultaneously size the energy buffer while optimally controlling a trajectory following system. The energy buffers are capacitors and batteries with quadratic power losses, while the resulting convex problem is a semidefinite program. The convex modeling steps are described through a problem of optimal buffer sizing and control of a hybrid electric vehicle. The studied vehicle is a city bus driven along a perfectly known bus line. The paper also shows modeling steps for alternative convex models where power losses and power limits of the energy buffer are approximated. The approximated models show significant decrease in computation time without visible impact on the optimal result.

                  Innovative analytically based method to calculate corrected fuel consumption of parallel and series hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) at balanced energy content of the electric storage devices is proposed and validated in the paper. The proposed analytical method is generally applicable and features highly accurate corrected fuel consumption results. It enables calculation of the corrected fuel consumption out of a single fuel consumption test run in a single analytic post-processing step. An additional fuel consumption test run might be needed to obtain highly accurate results if ratio of the energy content deviation of the electric storage devices to the energy used for vehicle propulsion over the test cycle is high. Proposed method enables consideration of non-linear energy flow changes and non-linear HEV component efficiency changes caused by the energy management strategy or by the component characteristics. The method therefore features highly accurate results out of the minimum number of fuel consumption test runs and thus optimizes workload for development or optimization of HEVs. The input data of the method are characteristic energy flows and efficiencies that are derived from the energy flows on selected energy paths of HEVs.

                  New equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) tools have been developed and applied to identify the optimal control strategy of a dual-mode parallel hybrid electric vehicle equipped with a compression-ignition engine. In this architecture, the electric machine is coupled to the engine through either a single-speed gearbox (torque-coupling) or a planetary gear set (speed-coupling).
                  One of the main novelties of the present study concerns the definition of the instantaneous equivalent consumption (EC) function, which takes into account not only fuel consumption (FC) and the energy flow through the electric components, but also NOx emissions, battery aging, and the battery SOC.
                  The EC function has been trained using a cross-validation machine-learning technique, based on a genetic algorithm, where the training data set has been selected in order to maximize performances over a testing data set. The adoption of this technique, in conjunction with the new definition of EC, have led to the identification of very robust controllers, which provide an accurate control for different driving scenarios, even when the EC function is not specifically trained on the same missions over which it is tested. To this aim, a data set of fifty driving cycles and six user-defined missions, which cover a total distance of 70–100km, has been considered as a training driving set.
                  The ECMS controllers can be implemented in a vehicle control unit, and their performance has resulted to be close to that of a dynamic programming tool, which has here been used as benchmark, over a large set of different missions, without need for feedback control on the battery SOC or driving pattern prediction.

A DC/DC boost converter interfaces between FC and Dc-Link, and two buck-boost converters connect UC and battery to DC-Link respectively. Dynamic model of FCEVs with different HPS are developed based on the nonlinear behavior of subsystems. The main purpose is to design a controller for simultaneous control of DC/DC converters. This paper proposes a nonlinear control approach based on Lyapunov theory to insure following control objectives: 1- regulation of the DC-link voltage, 2- definition of FC reference current, 3- impeccable tracking of power sources' reference currents. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop systems are also insured in various conditions. The performance of the proposed controllers is validated and compared via numerical simulations. The simulation results show that the UC and battery can assist the FC to meet the load demand and improve its performance.

                  Hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles (HEVs, PHEVs, and EVs) are emerging automotive products that have the capability to increase vehicle fuel economy, but at an incremental purchase cost relative to conventional vehicles. In general, their reduced petroleum consumption and improved efficiency provides life cycle economic benefits to consumers, society, automakers, and policymakers. These stakeholders have sought to understand the role of HEVs, PHEVs, and EVs in the future vehicle fleets by estimating the diffusion rate of these technologies into the automotive marketplace. This review presents a comprehensive summary of the literature of HEV, PHEV and EV penetration rate studies, their methods, and their recommendations. These studies have applied a suite of analytical and computational tools to model the consumer acceptability of these technologies under a wide variety of policy and macroeconomic scenarios. The results of these studies are compared and synthesized to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the field and to propose further means for improvement of advanced technology vehicle market modeling exercises. On the basis of this review, the authors recommend that modeling of HEV, PHEV and EV penetration rates should include improved interfaces with consumer surveys, modeling of automakers' actions, federal and state policy and its effect on automotive markets, competition among technologies, market volume, vehicle classifications, and model parameters sensitivity analysis.

                  Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are promoted in China to ease increasing pressures of urban air pollution and oil security. In this paper, we measured two Toyota Prius HEVs by using a portable emission measurement system (PEMS) to evaluate their real–world performance with regard to gaseous emission factors and fuel consumption. Our results indicated that their average exhaust emission factors of CO, THC, NOX and CO2 were 0.25±0.08 gkm–1, 0.015±0.002 gkm–1, 0.009±0.005 gkm–1 and 136±21 gkm–1 (i.e., 5.81±0.90 L 100km–1 for fuel consumption) respectively, while driving the averaged on–road traffic pattern. Compared to conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles, the tested HEVs demonstrated significant advantages in simultaneously mitigating major air pollutants (e.g., NOX), greenhouse gas emissions (CO2) and fuel consumption. For example, average CO2 emission factors are reduced by approximately 35% and 15% relative to conventional gasoline and diesel cars in Macao. Unlike conventional gasoline and diesel cars, relative CO2 emission factors of HEVs were much less sensitive to speed change, while their relative NOX emission factors were reduced as average speed became lower. This indicates significant environmental and energy benefits from HEVs under congested driving conditions. Our assessment suggests that HEVs are a competitive technology option for the taxi fleet in Macao with strong advantages in saving fuel cost for taxi drivers and mitigating NOX emissions.

                  Energy-saving technologies have a difficult time being widely accepted in the marketplace when they have a high initial purchase price and deferred financial benefits. Consumers might not realize that, in the long-run, the financial benefits from reduced energy consumption offset much or all of the initial price premium. One strategy to address consumer misconception of this advantage is to supply information on the “total cost of ownership”, a metric which accounts for the purchase price, the cost of the fuel, and other costs over the ownership period. In this article, we investigate how providing information on five-year fuel cost savings and total cost of ownership affects the stated preferences of consumers to purchase a gasoline, conventional hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or battery electric vehicle. Through an online survey with an embedded experimental design using distinct labels, we find that respondent rankings of vehicles are unaffected by information on five-year fuel cost savings. However, adding information about total cost of ownership increases the probability that small/mid-sized car consumers express a preference to acquire a conventional hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or a battery-electric vehicle. No such effect is found for consumers of small sport utility vehicles. Our results are consistent with other findings in the behavioral economics literature and suggest that further evaluation of the effects of providing consumers with information on the total cost of vehicle ownership is warranted.

                  Emerging issues on fuel price and greenhouse gas emissions have attracted attention on the alternative energy sources, especially in transportation sector. The transportation sector accounts for 40% of total fuel consumption. Thus, an increasing number of studies have been conducted on hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and their energy management system (EMS). This paper focuses on reviews of EMSs for fuel cell (FC) based HEV in combination with battery and super-capacitor, respectively. Various aspects and classifications of fuel cell–HEV EMS are explained in this paper. Different types of FC–HEV control models and algorithms derived from simulation and experiment are explained in details for an analytical justification for the most optimal control strategy. The performances of the various combinations of FC–HEV system are summarized in the table along with relevant references. This paper provides comprehensive survey of FC–HEV on their source combination, models, energy management system (EMS) etc. developed by various researchers. From the rigorous review, it is observed that the existing technologies more or less are capable to perform well; however, the reliability and the intelligent systems are still not up to the mark. Accordingly, current issues and challenges on the FC–HEV technologies are highlighted with a brief suggestions and discussion for the progress of future FC–HEV vehicle research. This review will hopefully lead to increasing efforts towards the development of economic, longer lifetime, hydrogen viable, efficient electronic interface and well performed EMS for future FC–HEV.

                  Due to the narrow flammability of gasoline, pure gasoline-fueled spark-ignited (SI) engines always encounter partial burning or even misfire at lean conditions. Gasoline engines tend to suffer poor combustion and expel large emissions at idle conditions because of the high variation in the intake charge and low combustion temperature. Comparatively, hybrid hydrogen engines (HHE) fueled with the mixtures of hydrocarbon fuels and hydrogen seem to achieve lower emissions and gain higher thermal efficiencies than the original hydrocarbon-fueled engines due to the wide flammability and high flame speed of hydrogen. Since a HHE only requires a small amount of hydrogen, it also removes concerns about the high production and storage costs of hydrogen. This paper introduced an experiment conducted on a four-cylinder SI gasoline engine equipped with a hydrogen port-injection system to explore the performance of a hybrid hydrogen–gasoline engine (HHGE) at idle and lean conditions. The injection timings and durations of hydrogen and gasoline were governed by a hybrid electronic control unit (HECU) developed by the authors, which can be adjusted freely according to the commands from a calibration computer. During the test, hydrogen flow rate was varied to ensure that hydrogen volume fraction in the intake was constantly kept at 3%. For the specified hydrogen addition level, gasoline flow rate was reduced to make the engine operate at idle and lean conditions with various excess air ratios. The test results demonstrated that cyclic variations in engine idle speed and indicated mean effective pressure were eased with hydrogen enrichment. The indicated thermal efficiency was obviously higher for the HHGE than that for the original gasoline engine at idle and lean conditions. The indicated thermal efficiency at an excess air ratio of 1.37 was increased from 13.81% for the original gasoline engine to 20.20% for the HHGE with a 3% hydrogen blending level. Flame development and propagation periods were also evidently shortened after hydrogen blending. Moreover, HC, CO and NOx emissions were all improved after hydrogen enrichment at idle and lean conditions. Therefore, the HHE methodology is an effective and promising way for improving engine idle performance at lean conditions.

                  To address the air pollution problems and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) have been developed to achieve higher fuel efficiency. The Energy Management System (EMS) is a very important component of a PHEV in achieving better fuel economy and it is a very active research area. So far, most of the existing EMS strategies are either just simply following predefined rules that are not adaptive to changing driving conditions; or heavily relying on accurate prediction of future traffic conditions. Deep learning algorithms have been successfully applied to many complex problems and proved to even outperform human beings in some tasks (e.g., play chess) in recent years, which shows the great potential of such methods in practical engineering problems. In this study, a deep reinforcement learning (Deep Q-network or DQN) based PHEV energy management system is designed to autonomously learn the optimal fuel/electricity splits from interactions between the vehicle and the traffic environment. It is a fully data-driven and self-learning model that does not rely on any prediction, predefined rules or even prior human knowledge. The experiment results show that the proposed model is capable of achieving 16.3% energy savings (with the designed PHEV simulation model) on a typical commute trip, compared to conventional binary control strategies. In addition, a dueling Deep Q-network with dueling structure (DDQN) is also implemented and compared with single DQN in particular with respect to the convergence rate in the training process.

                  Recent results in plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) power management research suggest that battery energy capacity requirements may be reduced through proper power management algorithm design. Specifically, algorithms which blend fuel and electricity during the charge depletion phase using smaller batteries may perform equally to algorithms that apply electric-only operation during charge depletion using larger batteries. The implication of this result is that “blended” power management algorithms may reduce battery energy capacity requirements, thereby lowering the acquisition costs of PHEVs. This article seeks to quantify the tradeoffs between power management algorithm design and battery energy capacity, in a systematic and rigorous manner. Namely, we (1) construct dynamic PHEV models with scalable battery energy capacities, (2) optimize power management using stochastic control theory, and (3) develop simulation methods to statistically quantify the performance tradeoffs. The degree to which blending enables smaller battery energy capacities is evaluated as a function of both daily driving distance and energy (fuel and electricity) pricing.

                  Vehicle’s powertrain performance and comfort are largely depending on the clutch control strategy for an Automated Manual Transmission (AMT). The aim of the clutch control strategy is to ensure the smooth running of clutch operational cases: a comfortable clutch launch (vehicle takes off smoothly without jerk), a fast upshift/downshift (gear ratio changes) and a fast clutch opening. In most industrial cases, regardless of clutch actuation technology, clutch control is managed by clutch pressure control. However, the clutch pressure control is a challenge regarding clutch non-linearities and time-varying parameters. In this paper, a parallel adaptive feedforward and bang-bang controller is proposed in order to control the clutch pressure with an electromechanical clutch actuator. In this system, a control issue comes from potential time-varying parameters but the main challenge comes from the hysteretic behavior of the system due to dry friction in the actuator assembly. An analytic model of the clutch and its electromechanical actuator including dry friction has been constructed and a prototype has been designed and integrated on a test bench. The parallel adaptive feedforward and bang-bang controller architecture and algorithms are developed. For three critical clutch operational cases, simulations and experiments have been run. Finally, in spite of time-varying parameters and a high hysteretic system behavior, simulation and experimental control results highlight that the controller allows a precise tracking of the pressure reference and a fast time response.

                  Electrochemical capacitors, called supercapacitors (SCs) or ultracapacitors, are devices conveniently used for embedded electrical energy management owing to their huge capacitance, low internal resistance and flexible control through power electronic conversion. This paper proposes a main power supply of hybrid Wind Generator (WG)–SC within the train station for feeding the traction onboard SC through specified limited feeding transit durations. Onboard SCs provide the train with the requested start–up self–energy. The hybrid WG–SCs system is an environmental–friendly source that enables the independency on national grid and guarantees an efficient bidirectional power transfer for energy management with enhanced dynamic performance. Therefore, the dynamic modelling and the experimental analysis of the modern hybrid WG–SCs used for managing the charge/discharge operation of SCs at Unity Power Factor (UPF) mode are presented. For this purpose, the Port–Controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) methodology is deduced and explicitly presented. Simulation results, via MATLAB™, reveal that the proposed PCH control methodology can be successfully implemented to ensure acceptable system dynamic behavior. Numerical results are validated with experimental measurements to investigate the significance of the PCH approach for the energy management operation in eco-tractions.

At 175°C, normal creep behaviour, i.e., strain rate decreasing with strain and then reaching a steady state, is observed at all the stresses employed.

At 300°C, reverse creep behaviour is observed at all the stresses employed. This pattern remains the same for all the composites. The reverse creep behaviour is found to be associated with the fibre breakage. The stress exponent is found to be very high for all the composites. However, after taking the threshold stress into account, the stress exponent varies from 3.9 to 7.0, which suggests viscous glide and dislocation climb being the dominant creep mechanisms.

                  This paper presents an evaluation of an optimized Hybrid Pneumatic-Combustion Engine (HPCE) concept that permits reducing fuel consumption for electricity production in non-interconnected remote areas, originally equipped with hybrid Wind–Diesel System (WDS). Up to now, most of the studies on the pneumatic hybridization of Internal Combustion Engines (ICE) have dealt with two-stroke pure pneumatic mode. The few studies that have dealt with hybrid pneumatic-combustion four-stroke mode require adding a supplementary valve to charge compressed air in the combustion chamber. This modification means that a new cylinder head should be fabricated. Moreover, those studies focus on spark ignition engines and are not yet validated for Diesel engines. Present HPCE is capable of making a Diesel engine operate under two-stroke pneumatic motor mode, two-stroke pneumatic pump mode and four-stroke hybrid mode, without needing an additional valve in the combustion chamber. This fact constitutes this study’s strength and innovation. The evaluation of the concept is based on ideal thermodynamic cycle modeling. The optimized valve actuation timings for all modes lead to generic maps that are independent of the engine size. The fuel economy is calculated for a known site during a whole year, function of the air storage volume and the wind power penetration rate.

                  This paper formulates energy efficient driving of gasoline and electric powered vehicles as optimal control problems of various complexity. We show minimizing aerodynamic drag can maximize utilization of energy available at the wheel and requires low and constant speeds. By employing optimal control theory we show periods of maximal acceleration, maximal braking, and coasting often accompany constant speed cruising to satisfy boundary conditions on the states (bang-singular-bang optimal control). In the case of gasoline engine vehicles, analytical optimal control derivations show that pulse and glide operation of the engine while cruising can further reduce fuel use (chattering optimal control). For electric vehicles (EV), quadratic rather than linear dependence of energy use on control input results in different eco-driving patterns from gasoline engine vehicles. For EVs, analytical solution to the two point boundary value optimal control problem could be obtained after model simplification which is compared to numerical solution based on a more accurate model. We also evaluate optimal control solution in the presence of state constraints for EVs. Several simulation case studies are presented to showcase the energy efficiency gains with proposed eco driving strategies.

                  This paper uses an adaptive extended Kalman filter (AEKF)-based method to jointly estimate the State of Charge (SoC) and peak power capability of a lithium-ion battery in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). First, to strengthen the links of the model's performance with battery's SoC, a dynamic electrochemical polarization battery model is employed for the state estimations. To get accurate parameters, we use four different charge–discharge current to improve the hybrid power pulse characteristic test. Second, the AEKF-based method is employed to achieve a robust SoC estimation. Third, due to the PHEVs require continuous peak power for acceleration, regenerative braking and gradient climbing, the continuous peak power capability estimation approach is proposed. And to improve its applicability, a general framework for six-step joint estimation approach for SoC and peak power capability is proposed. Lastly, a dynamic cycle test based on the urban dynamometer driving schedule is performed to evaluate the real-time performance and robustness of the joint estimation approach. The results show that the proposed approach can not only achieve an accurate SoC estimate and its estimation error is below 0.02 especially with big initial SoC error; but also gives reliable and robust peak power capability estimate.

                  Car manufactures have announced the launch in coming months of vehicles with reduced emissions due to the introduction of new functions like stop–start and regenerative braking. Initial performance request of automotive lead-acid batteries are becoming more and more demanding and, in addition to this, cycle life with new accelerated ageing profiles are being proposed in order to determine the influence of the new functions on the expected battery life. This paper will show how different lead-acid battery technologies comply with these new demands, from an improved version of the conventional flooded SLI battery to the high performance of spiral wound valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) battery. Different approaches have been studied for improving conventional flooded batteries, i.e., either by the addition of new additives for reducing electrolyte stratification or by optimisation of the battery design to extend cycling life in partial state of charge conditions. With respect to VRLA technology, two different battery designs have been compared. Spiral wound design combines excellent power capability and cycle life under different depth of discharge (DoD) cycling conditions, but flat plate design outperform the latter in energy density due to better utilization of the space available in a prismatic enclosure. This latter design is more adequate for high end class vehicles with high electrical energy demand, whereas spiral wound is better suited for high power/long life demand of commercial vehicle. High temperature behaviour (75°C) is rather poor for both designs due to water loss, and then VRLA batteries should preferably be located out of the engine compartment.

The adaptive supervisory control strategy is exploited based on this, incorporating an estimating algorithm for the vehicle accessorial power, an algorithm for the battery charge-sustaining and a Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm for fuel cell performance identification. Finally, an adaptive supervisory controller (ASC) considering the fuel consumption minimization, the battery charge-sustaining and the fuel cell durability has been implemented within the hybrid city buses. Results in the “China city bus typical cycle” testing and the demonstrational program of Beijing bus routes are presented, demonstrating that this approach provides an improvement of fuel economy along with robustness and ease of implementation. However, the fuel cell system does not leave much room for the optimal strategy to promote the fuel economy. Benefits may also result in a prolongation of the fuel cell working life, which needs to be verified in future.

                  Cycle to cycle variations are an important aspect in the development and optimization process of internal combustion engines. In this study the feasibility of using a detached eddy simulation (DES) SST model, which is a hybrid URANS/LES model, to predict cycle to cycle variations is investigated. In the near wall region or in regions where the grid resolution is not sufficiently fine to resolve smaller structures, the two-equation RANS shear-stress transport (SST) model is used. In the other regions with higher grid resolution an LES model is applied. First, the numerical requirements associated with the hybrid URANS/LES and the employed solver are studied in detail. The numerical dissipation of the spatial scheme and the choice of the temporal scheme including the step size are evaluated. In addition, the accuracy of the solver for moving meshes, which are required for engine calculations, is assessed. The modeling constant linking the grid size to the DES filter length scale is determined by calculating a decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence test case for different grid resolutions. The final applications of the model are two different engine cases with increasing complexity. The first case is the statistically stationary flow through an engine intake port. The time resolved flow structure predicted by the DES SST model is analyzed and the resulting time-averaged velocity fields are compared to experimental data at different locations. The second application is a motored multi-cycle simulation of a series production engine. The instantaneous flow development during the intake and compression stroke of one single cycle is studied and the ensemble-averaged and the instantaneous velocity fields as well as the resolved velocity fluctuations are compared to optical measurements. Special emphasis is placed on the cyclic differences of the velocity fluctuations at the time of ignition in the vicinity of the spark plug and the expected influence on the combustion process.

                  Facing the increasingly severe energy and environmental problems, platooning of multiple vehicles has great potential for sustainability of intelligent transportation systems. This study develops a novel hierarchical ECACC strategy with energy-saving achievements by conducting the ecological velocity trajectory planning of the leading vehicle based on dynamic programming and car-following driving of the rest of the vehicles in the platoon based on combined feedforward-feedback control. The main purpose is to reduce the energy consumption of multiple vehicles in intelligent transportation systems with consideration of trip time and car-following performance. The optimal velocity planning uses an innovative integrated longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics approach where both the lateral stability and energy efficiency in continuous curved roads are guaranteed at the same time. The results show that the proposed ECACC in energy-optimal mode can reduce energy consumption by up to 38.1% compared to conventional energy-optimal fixed speed cruising. Moreover, the connected automated vehicle platoon presents better car-following performance with string stability as opposed to the Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control based on feedback control and model predictive control. The results indicate the great potential of the proposed ECACC strategy to further improve the sustainability of intelligent transportation systems.

                  This paper presents a thermal analysis of a semi-active battery/supercapacitor (SC) hybrid energy storage system (HESS), which is used in electric vehicles (EVs), at subzero temperatures. In subzero temperature environments, EVs suffer a dramatic driving range loss due to the energy and power capability reduction of LiFePO4 batteries, as well as severe battery degradation due to Li plating. This will increase the system operation cost because the battery pack needs to be changed frequently. Based on a novel degradation model of LiFePO4 batteries, which is validated over a wide temperature range, a near-optimal energy management strategy of the HESS for on-line use is proposed using the dynamic programming (DP) approach, which minimizes the operation cost (the electricity and the battery fade costs) over a typical China Bus Drive Cycle (CBDC). The convective heating method is integrated into the DP process. Finally, the required heating of the HESS at subzero temperatures over multi-CBDC is analyzed by evaluating the system operation cost. Simulation results show that the heating process becomes increasingly necessary with increased driving range, battery price, and heating efficiency, as well as decreasing environment temperature.

Firstly, the main construction of the case-study electric car with regenerative braking system is introduced. Next, based on the phase plane theory, the optimal brake torque is calculated for ABS control of an electric vehicle. Then, an allocation control, wherein the required optimal brake torque is divided into two parts that are disposed respectively by the friction and regenerative brakes, is discussed. In addition, two parameters for evaluating regeneration braking energy efficiency contribution while in the deceleration braking process are defined. Furthermore, a novel regenerative braking control strategy named “serial control strategy” is proposed. Finally, the road tests are implemented in four types of tire-road adhesion conditions under safety-critical driving situations. The test results validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control strategy.

A energy-saving prototype is developed for a 23-ton hydraulic excavator. Several tests are carried out to evaluate the prototype from the perspectives of energy consumption, action performance, and system comfortableness. Results show that the excavator equipped with the energy-saving system can be reduced by approximately 17.6% compared with a conventional one. The braking time of the boom-lowering process is about 1.87 times that of the conventional system. The electric motor is the main vibration source, and the impact of hydraulic system shock on comfortableness is indirect. The results are important reference for further system optimization.

                  In March 2007 the BMW Group has launched the micro-hybrid functions brake energy regeneration (BER) and automatic start and stop function (ASSF). Valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries in absorbent glass mat (AGM) technology are applied in vehicles with micro-hybrid power system (MHPS). In both part I and part II of this publication vehicles with MHPS and AGM batteries are subject to a field operational test (FOT). Test vehicles with conventional power system (CPS) and flooded batteries were used as a reference. In the FOT sample batteries were mounted several times and electrically tested in the laboratory intermediately. Vehicle- and battery-related diagnosis data were read out for each test run and were matched with laboratory data in a data base. The FOT data were analyzed by the use of two-dimensional, nonparametric kernel estimation for clear data presentation.
                  The data show that capacity loss in the MHPS is comparable to the CPS. However, the influence of mileage performance, which cannot be separated, suggests that battery stress is enhanced in the MHPS although a battery refresh function is applied. Anyway, the FOT demonstrates the unsuitability of flooded batteries for the MHPS because of high early capacity loss due to acid stratification and because of vanishing cranking performance due to increasing internal resistance. Furthermore, the lack of dynamic charge acceptance for high energy regeneration efficiency is illustrated. Under the presented FOT conditions charge acceptance of lead-acid (LA) batteries decreases to less than one third for about half of the sample batteries compared to new battery condition. In part II of this publication FOT data are presented by multiple regression analysis (Schaeck et al., submitted for publication [1]).

                  The framework of minimum sensor helps reduce the number of sensors in vehicle automation. This framework is a promising approach to decrease hardware costs of driverless vehicles without significantly losing desirable performance and reliability. Even though cost is not the concern, it also provides a straightforward fault-tolerant solution in case of sensor failures. This paper presents a terminal sliding mode (TSM) controller for automated car-following systems, where only the radar is additionally equipped and no acceleration information is used. The automated controller design is based on the so-called finite-time convergence concept after compensating for the nonlinearities of powertrain dynamics via an inverse model. The controller uses a terminal function with non-integer exponents to improve the convergence rate of sliding mode, and designs a matched terminal attractor as the reaching law outside of sliding mode. The newly designed TSM controller has high robustness to modeling uncertainties and external disturbances, without the issues of singularity and chattering that are usually accompanied with conventional counterparties. For nominal conditions, it is proved that the inter-vehicle state from any initial position asymptotically converges to zero. For uncertain conditions, the bounded closed-loop stability is guaranteed under some mild assumptions on preceding vehicle acceleration and road slope. The effectiveness of this controller is validated using computer simulations and road tests on a passenger car equipped with an internal combustion engine and 5-speed automatic transmission.

                  Three Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) implementations are developed for control of a diesel-electric wheel loader transmission. The implementations each use a stochastic description of the load, with the probabilities either independent of the states, dependent on previous power or on distance driven. Both the cycles used for the controller development and for the evaluation are derived from a measured sequence of cycles.
                  The evaluation shows that SDP can be used for control of the engine speed and that the resulting trajectories from the three implementations are very similar. The most surprising part is that the method which has constant load probability is able to adjust to the actual load.

                  The output of renewable energy is the power of low voltage and high current rated designs. Due to the output voltage being too low it does not meet the required maximum voltage load requirements.

The DC output voltage from a renewable energy source is given as input to a DC-DC converter, and the output generated from the converter is used to drive a load. KY boost converter is one of the recently developed DC-DC converters to reduce output voltage ripple. It is suitable for operation in equipment to below low ripple conditions. The disadvantage of this converter is that the boost voltage is a very low design parameter. To obtain the desired boosted voltage, and also to reduce the output voltage ripple, an optimized algorithm is used. Compared with the existing Drosophila optimization technology, the proposed Adaptive Vector Reference Control (AVRC) Method has higher convergence characteristics and lower output ripple.

                  The aim of this paper is to further improve the fuel efficiency and keep the balance of battery SOC simultaneously during urban driving. A dynamic programming (DP)-optimized HEV power management control strategy is proposed. The DP algorithm is applied to obtain the optimal engine/motor power distribution and utilized for the design of the fuzzy control strategy. The traditional DP algorithm is modified with the consideration of SOC balance for HEVs. In the analysis of DP simulation results, rules of torque slip behaviors have been found, which are directly utilized in the design of fuzzy control strategy. In order to improve the practicality of the control strategy to meet the diversities of city driving patterns, an urban driving pattern recognition method is presented. To evaluate the control performance, the proposed control strategy is also compared with the conventional rule-based strategy. The simulation results indicate that by adopting the proposed strategy the fuel efficiency of HEV is improved, and the SOC of the battery is kept in balance during different urban driving cycles.

The controller decouples gear scheduling into an offline optimization problem, from the remaining optimization problem that governs two real-valued states. One of the states, the travel time, is adjoined to the objective by applying the necessary optimality conditions, which results into an online optimization problem that has kinetic energy as the single state. Finally an inner approximation is proposed for the online problem to obtain a quadratic program that can be solved efficiently. The efficiency of the proposed controller is shown for different horizon lengths.

                  Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) use grid electricity as well as on-board gasoline for motive force. These multiple energy sources make prediction of PHEV energy consumption challenging and also complicate evaluation of their environmental impacts. This paper introduces a novel PHEV energy consumption modeling approach and compares it to a second approach from the literature, each using actual trip patterns from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). The first approach applies distance-dependent fuel efficiency and on-road electricity consumption rates based on naturalistic or real world, driving information to determine gasoline and electricity consumption. The second uses consumption rates derived in accordance with government certification testing. Both approaches are applied in the context of a location-specific case study that focuses on the state of Michigan. The two PHEV models show agreement in electricity demand due to vehicle charging, gasoline consumption, and life cycle environmental impacts for this case study. The naturalistic drive cycle approach is explored as a means of extending location-specific driving data to supplement existing PHEV impact assessments methods.

                  Policymakers as well as corporate managers want to know how to gain the lead and benefit from a paradigmatic shift in technology. This paper develops and uses a combined policy and firm-level theoretical framework to derive policy implications from a case study of the development of battery, hybrid and fuel cell electric vehicles (BEVs, HEVs and FCVs) in Japan. Among the implications of the study, it is argued that Japanese national policy has so far had a limited direct role in the electrification of vehicles; this has been very largely decided and carried out in-house at the automakers. Policymakers need to consider this as well as the inherently international nature of the automotive industry. One key factor behind Toyota's and Honda's early and sustained lead in the electrification trajectory is the intense and in some aspects quite specific type of competition on the domestic market, which has nurtured firms with a strong product development capability. Finally, it is argued that the proposed theoretical framework contributes to a more balanced view of the role of policy in this potential paradigmatic shift in technology in a mature industry, compared to traditional policy or firm-level approaches.

                  Within electrified vehicle powertrains, lithium-ion battery performance degrades with aging and usage, resulting in a loss in both energy and power capacity. As a result, models used for system design and control algorithm development would ideally capture the impact of those efforts on battery capacity degradation, be computationally efficient, and simple enough to be used for algorithm development. This paper provides an assessment of the state-of-the-art in lithium-ion battery degradation models, including accuracy, computational complexity, and amenability to control algorithm development. Various aging and degradation models have been studied in the literature, including physics-based electrochemical models, semi-empirical models, and empirical models. Some of these models have been validated with experimental data; however, comparisons of pre-existing degradation models across multiple experimental data sets have not been previously published. Three representative models, a 1-d electrochemical model (a combination of performance model and degradation model), a semi-empirical degradation model (the performance is predicted by an equivalent circuit model) and an empirical degradation model (the performance is predicted by an equivalent circuit model), are compared against four published experimental data sets for a 2.3-Ah commercial graphite/LiFePO

                  Micro-hybrid electric vehicles were launched by BMW in March 2007. These are equipped with brake energy regeneration (BER) and the automatic start and stop function (ASSF) of the internal combustion engine. These functions are based on common 14V series components and lead-acid (LA) batteries. The novelty is given by the intelligent onboard energy management, which upgrades the conventional electric system to the micro-hybrid power system (MHPS). In part I of this publication the key factors for the operation of LA batteries in the MHPS are discussed. Especially for BER one is high dynamic charge acceptance (DCA) for effective boost charging. Vehicle rest time is identified as a particular negative parameter for DCA. It can be refreshed by regular fully charging at elevated charge voltage. Thus, the batteries have to be outstandingly robust against overcharge and water loss. This can be accomplished for valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries at least if they are mounted in the trunk. ASSF goes along with frequent high-rate loads for warm cranking. The internal resistance determines the drop of the power net voltage during cranking and is preferably low for reasons of power net stability even after years of operation. Investigations have to be done with aged 90Ah VRLA–absorbent glass mat (AGM) batteries. Battery operation at partial state-of-charge gives a higher risk of deep discharging (overdischarging). Subsequent re-charging then is likely to lead to the formation of micro-short circuits in the absorbent glass mat separator.

                  Because the fuel efficiency of excavators is low and the energy loss is considerable, a prediction-based stochastic dynamic programming (PBSDP) control strategy is proposed in this study to reduce the energy and fuel consumptions. Using the torque prediction method, the optimization control strategy can be used in real time to improve the fuel efficiency. The required torque of the proposed hydraulic hybrid excavator was analyzed. The minimum length of the required torque sample needed to estimate the trend in the required torque change was obtained using approximate mean estimation. The required torque sample was divided into complete cycles using empirical mode decomposition. The required torque of the next period was predicted using a signal superposition technique. The proposed PBSDP control strategy was then applied based on the predicted required torque. The displacement of the auxiliary pump/motor was selected as the control variable whereas the pressure of the accumulator connected to the auxiliary pump/motor was selected as the state variable. The value function was calculated based on the predicted required torque and charging state of the accumulator. The controller was used to minimize the value function by adjusting the displacement of the auxiliary pump/motor. In addition, a numerical experiment was conducted to analyze the rotation torque, energy consumption, and fuel consumption of an internal combustion engine (ICE). The numerical experiment results show that the proposed PBSDP control strategy helps in reducing the maximum torque, energy consumption, and fuel consumption of the ICE by 15, 20, and 26%, respectively.

The optimal management algorithm described herein is based on discrete dynamic programming theory (DDP) and was designed for the purpose of PHEV battery degradation management; its operation relies on simulation models using data obtained experimentally on a physical PHEV platform. These tools are first used to define an optimal management strategy according to the economical weights of PHEV battery degradation and the secondary energy carriers spent to manage its deleterious effects. We then conduct a sensitivity study of the proposed optimization process to the fluctuating economic parameters associated with the fuel and energy costs involved in the degradation management process. Results demonstrate the influence of each parameter on the process's response, including daily total operating costs and expected battery lifetime, as well as establish boundaries for useful application of the method; in addition, they provide a case for the relevance of inexpensive battery technologies, such as lead-acid batteries, for economy-centric PHEV applications where battery degradation is a major concern.

We then conduct a sensitivity study of the proposed optimization process to the fluctuating economic parameters associated with the fuel and energy costs involved in the degradation management process. Results demonstrate the influence of each parameter on the process's response, including daily total operating costs and expected battery lifetime, as well as establish boundaries for useful application of the method; in addition, they provide a case for the relevance of inexpensive battery technologies, such as lead-acid batteries, for economy-centric PHEV applications where battery degradation is a major concern.

After an introduction to advanced propulsion technologies the development of FCEV at DaimlerChrysler is described, followed by a discussion on hydrogen as a fuel for FCEV and the challenges related to hydrogen storage. It is essential for advanced vehicles to obtain a range comparable to that of mass production vehicles sold today. Thus, there is a strong need to operate such vehicles with high efficiency and maximize the energy stored onboard a vehicle. A stochastic dynamic programming algorithm was developed and applied to the energy management of this FCEV, which allow fuel economy optimisation while keeping a good driveability.

                  Electric vehicles (EVs) are promising alternative to conventional vehicles, due to their low fuel cost and low emissions. As a subset of EVs, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) backup batteries with combustion engines, and thus have a longer traveling range than battery electric vehicles (BEVs). However, the energy cost of a PHEV is higher than a BEV because the gasoline price is higher than the electricity price. Hence, choosing a route with more charging opportunities may result in less fuel cost than the shortest route. Different with the traditional shortest-path and shortest-time routing methods, we propose a new routing choice with the lowest fuel cost for PHEV drivers. Existing algorithms for gasoline vehicles cannot be applied because they never considered the regenerative braking which may result in negative energy consumption on some road segments. Existing algorithms for BEVs are not competent too because PHEVs have two power sources. Thus, even if along the same route, different options of power source will lead to different energy consumption. This paper proposes a cost-optimal algorithm (COA) to deal with the challenges. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using real-world maps and data. The results show that there is a trade-off between traveling cost and time consumed when driving PHEVs. It is also observed that the average detour rate caused by COA is less than 14%. Significantly, the algorithm averagely saves more than 48% energy cost compared to the shortest-time routing.

                  Plug-in electric vehicles can potentially emit substantially lower CO2 emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles, and so have the potential to reduce transport emissions without curtailing personal car use. Assessing the potential uptake of these new categories of vehicles requires an understanding of likely consumer responses. Previous in-depth explorations of appraisals and evaluations of electric vehicles have tended to focus on ‘early adopters’, who may not represent mainstream consumers. This paper reports a qualitative analysis of responses to electric cars, based on semi-structured interviews conducted with 40 UK non-commercial drivers (20 males, 20 females; age 24–70years) at the end of a seven-day period of using a battery electric car (20 participants) or a plug-in hybrid car (20 participants). Six core categories of response were identified: (1) cost minimisation; (2) vehicle confidence; (3) vehicle adaptation demands; (4) environmental beliefs; (5) impression management; and, underpinning all other categories, (6) the perception of electric cars generally as ‘work in progress’ products. Results highlight potential barriers to the uptake of current-generation (2010) plug-in electric cars by mainstream consumers. These include the prioritization of personal mobility needs over environmental benefits, concerns over the social desirability of electric vehicle use, and the expectation that rapid technological and infrastructural developments will make current models obsolete. Implications for the potential uptake of future electric vehicles are discussed.

With the aims of guaranteeing vehicle stability in various types of tyre–road adhesion conditions, based on the characteristics of electrified powertrain, a novel control algorithm of regenerative braking system is proposed for electric vehicles during anti-lock braking procedures. First, the models of vehicle dynamics and main components including braking energy regenerative system of the case-study electric bus are built in MATLAB/Simulink. Then, based on the phase-plane method, the optimal brake torque is calculated for ABS control of vehicle. Next, a novel allocation strategy, wherein the target optimal brake torque is divided into two parts that are handled separately by the regenerative and friction brakes, is developed. Simulations of the proposed control strategy are conducted based on system models built using MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results demonstrate that the developed strategy enables improved control in terms of vehicle stability and braking performance under different emergency driving conditions. To further verify the synthesized control algorithm, hardware-in-the-loop tests are also performed. The experimental results validate the simulation data and verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed control algorithm.

                  In the new generation of torque converter automatic transmissions (ATs), characterized by a high number of gears, multi-step gear shifts may be executed frequently in order to improve the driving performance. They include double-transition shifts (DTSs), which require close coordination between multiple control inputs (e.g. torque capacities of four clutches and engine torque). The previously developed AT control trajectory optimization tool is utilized in this paper for the purpose of DTS control optimization including engine torque control. With the aim to gain insights into optimal control action and coordination, six different DTS control strategies are proposed and assessed. These strategies are incorporated into the optimization problem formulation through additional, shift phase-related constraints that the optimization algorithm needs to satisfy. In this way, control strategies with different degrees of complexity and applicability can be quantitatively assessed in terms of achievable shift performance. The proposed strategies have been examined on an example of characteristic DTS downshift of an advanced 10-speed AT. Based on the summarized optimization results obtained for different levels of clutch energy loss penalization, it has been found that the strategy characterized with quick release of the off-going clutches can provide an optimal compromise between shift comfort performance and energy loss reduction.
               ","r automatic transmissions (ATs), characterized by a high number of gears, multi-step gear shifts may be executed frequently in order to improve the driving performance. They include double-transition shifts (DTSs), which require close coordination between multiple control inputs (e.g. torque capacities of four clutches and engine torque). The previously developed AT control trajectory optimization tool is utilized in this paper for the purpose of DTS control optimization including engine torque control. With the aim to gain insights into optimal control action and coordination, six different DTS control strategies are proposed and assessed.

                  Sensorless control of Electric Vehicle (EV) drives is considered to be an effective approach to improve system reliability and to reduce component costs. In this paper, relevant aspects relating to the sensorless operation of EVs are reported. As an initial contribution, a hybrid sensorless control algorithm is presented that is suitable for a variety of synchronous machines. The proposed method is simple to implement and its relatively low computational cost is a desirable feature for automotive microprocessors with limited computational capabilities. An experimental validation of the proposal is performed on a full-scale automotive grade platform housing a 51 kW Permanent Magnet assisted Synchronous Reluctance Machine (PM-assisted SynRM). Due to the operational requirements of EVs, both the strategy presented in this paper and other hybrid sensorless control strategies rely on High Frequency Injection (HFI) techniques, to determine the rotor position at standstill and at low speeds. The introduction of additional high frequency perturbations increases the power losses, thereby reducing the overall efficiency of the drive. Hence, a second contribution of this work is a simulation platform for the characterization of power losses in both synchronous machines and a Voltage Source Inverters (VSI). Finally, as a third contribution and considering the central concerns of efficiency and autonomy in EV applications, the impact of power losses are analyzed. The operational requirements of High Frequency Injection (HFI) are experimentally obtained and, using state-of-the-art digital simulation, a detailed loss analysis is performed during real automotive driving cycles. Based on the results, practical considerations are presented in the conclusions relating to EV sensorless control.

                  Previous well-to-wheels (WTW) analyses on electric vehicles (EVs) have reported tremendous results of potential energy and environmental effects. However, there remains a challenge to lower the uncertainties that were introduced when obtaining life-cycle parameters from a macro perspective (e.g., nationwide or regional scales). This study takes Beijing as a case, because it is an important regional hub for EV promotion and represents megacities with severe urban air pollution issues and congested traffic conditions. We collected up-to-date data concerning the electricity generation mix, fuel transport, end-of-pipe controls, real-world fuel economy and emissions, and estimated the WTW energy consumption and CO2 and air pollutant emissions for various light-duty passenger vehicle technologies currently (2015) and in the mid-term future (2030). Unlike previous results, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are shown to significantly reduce WTW CO2 emissions by 32% for the present model year (MY) 2015 compared with their conventional gasoline counterparts, primarily due to the shift from coal to gas in local power plants in Beijing and the significantly higher real-world fuel consumption of conventional vehicles compared with the type-approval value. By 2030, WTW CO2 emissions by BEVs should approach 100gkm−1 due to the increased importation of non-fossil electricity, even lower than that of hybrid electric vehicles. Furthermore, significant improvements in end-of-pipe controls for coal-fired power plants have effectively lowered WTW emissions of air pollutants. In terms of VOCs and NOX that are of most concerns among all pollutants emitted from passenger vehicles, the WTW emissions of VOCs for MY 2015 BEV are already significantly lower than their conventional counterparts by 95%. Although WTW NOX emissions for BEVs are currently higher by 66% than conventional gasoline vehicles, we expect that BEVs can achieve WTW emission reduction benefit of NOX (41%) by 2030. This study indicates the significance of fine-grained and real-world features when assessing the WTW energy and environmental effects of EVs.

                  To alleviate the problem of limited driving range per charge in electric vehicles, a dual clutch transmission based regenerative braking power-on shifting control system is proposed and investigated in this paper. Power-on shifting refers to the shift process where the power flow between the wheel and the power source is not cut off and could be maintained around a desirable value. This character is more important for regenerative braking than the normal driving conditions as the regenerative braking force from the motor accounts for a large part of the total braking force. Due to the difference between the normal driving condition and the regenerative braking process, existing normal driving shifting control strategies, which could introduce significant torque interruption, cannot be directly applied for regenerative braking. As a result, the energy recovery capability and efficiency are compromised. To solve this problem, a power-on shifting control strategy for regenerative braking is proposed as well as an energy-safety oriented braking strategy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, mathematical models are built and dynamic responses of the transmission system during braking both in up-shift and down-shift processes are presented. Moreover, the efficiency and recovery capability improvements made by achieving power-on shifting during regenerative braking are verified through a typical deceleration driving cycle and a specially designed daily deceleration scenario.

To solve this problem, a power-on shifting control strategy for regenerative braking is proposed as well as an energy-safety oriented braking strategy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system, mathematical models are built and dynamic responses of the transmission system during braking both in up-shift and down-shift processes are presented. Moreover, the efficiency and recovery capability improvements made by achieving power-on shifting during regenerative braking are verified through a typical deceleration driving cycle and a specially designed daily deceleration scenario.

The operation procedure of the fuel cell system can be generally separated into several processes, e.g. starting up, normal/abnormal working and shutting down. In this paper, a multi-mode real-time control strategy for a FCEV is proposed. The strategy is established based on three typical processes (starting up, normal working, shutting down) of the fuel cell system, taking the fuel economy and system durability into consideration.

Experiments of the “China city bus typical cycle” on a test bench for the bus were carried out. Results show that, the fuel economy is 7.6kg (100km)−1 in the battery charge-sustaining status. In a practical situation, a total driving mileage of more than 270km can be achieved. Cycle testing also showed that, the degradation rate of the fuel cell was reduced to half of the original level.

Firstly, an energy flow model describing the relations between vehicle performance and power flow parameters is quantitatively established. An optimization problem for maximizing driving mileage on a predetermined route is defined, and an analytical solution with clear physical meanings is derived. Next, a practical real-time supervisory Energy Management strategy basing on Mean Values (EMMV) is proposed. The strategy, which doesn't require a priori knowledge of the driving trip, is then compared with several well-known strategies, e.g. charge depleting and charge-sustaining (CDCS), Blended, dynamic programming (DP), and Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP). Simulation results show that, the proposed strategy achieves a near-optimal effect, and converges after one driving cycle on a predetermined bus route. Finally, on-road testing is carried out. The proposed strategy achieves an average endurance mileage on a real bus route of 162 km with a usable battery state of charge (SOC) of 90% and 20 kg hydrogen gas for a fully loaded fuel cell city bus.

                  In this paper, nonlinear optimal control schemes are proposed to reduce transferring time, energy consumption, and residual vibration for the payload’s skew rotation process of crane systems. The main contribution of this paper is to reduce the energy consumption without trading-off the sub-optimal transferring time. The novel idea is to use an electro-mechanical clutch to intelligently disengage the connection between the motor and the payload during the motion such that the payload can continue rotating only by its own momentum. As a result, a switched optimal control problem must be realized. Two solutions, namely particular and general schemes are proposed in the paper, where physical constraints of the actuator including bounded velocity and bounded acceleration are explicitly taken into account. Both simulation and experimental results are provided to prove the effectiveness of the proposed optimal control systems. The established schemes can be directly applied to transfer the payload to a desirable skew orientation without any residual oscillation, or can be utilized as a sub-optimal-time reference trajectory planner of the skewing control module in either overhead or rotary crane systems. Furthermore, the hybrid rotation process presented in this paper, which is driven by the engaging/disengaging event of the clutch, can be served as a theoretical benchmark for any newly established switched optimal control method.

The standard MPC scheme is modified to incorporate (1) a block implementation scheme where a sub-string of the optimized input sequence is applied instead of a single value; (2) an additional constraint which guarantees that a Lyapunov function will decrease over time; (3) a variable implementation window that facilitates the stability constraint enforcement. Stability of the closed-loop system with the proposed algorithm is established. Examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the control scheme. The impacts of several key design parameters on the overall performance are also analyzed and discussed.

                  Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are considered an ideal solution for zero-emission vehicles. This study focuses on the warm-up strategy of the PEMFC system in an energy-type power train, which is widely used on city buses. Firstly, a system model was built and validated by experimental data. Based on the model, a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm was utilized to determine a warm-up method that optimizes global efficiency. Then, a rule-based analysis was carried out and a three-step strategy based on the DP algorithm was proposed in order to satisfy the demand of real-time control. Simulation results show that the efficiency optimization of the three-step strategy is very close to that of the dynamic programming algorithm. In addition, the effects of warm-up time and environment temperature on efficiency are discussed. Results show that a longer warm-up time and a higher environment temperature are helpful for improving efficiency.

                  Active noise control (ANC) is the most popular method for attenuating acoustic primary noise or disturbances by generating controllable secondary sources by which the output noise can be cancelled with the same amplitude but with opposite sign/sense. Most available ANC uses the secondary path modelling including filtered x least mean square (FxLMS) algorithm. The modelling requirement of the secondary path increases the complexity of the system implementation and decreases the control system performance. Recently several new ANC algorithms have been developed; in which there is no requirement for the modelling of the secondary path transfer function. In this regard, the aim of this paper is concerned about a narrowband feedforward ANC system in systems like air intake duct system and its novelty is to introduce all-pass filtered x LMS (APFxLMS) algorithm which do not require an estimation of the secondary path. Here first-order all pass filters with single parameter is used to improve the convergence of the LMS algorithm. The performance evaluation in terms of convergence speed of the proposed algorithm is validated with standard ANC without secondary path modelling. The results also show that the proposed method outperforms other LMS algorithm without secondary path modelling. The proposed narrowband LMS algorithm would benefit in the design of efficient feedforward ANC system that can realize noise control in air intake duct applications.

In real time, at high power and at high speed, two phenomena are observed. The first is obtained at higher required power, and the second is observed at sudden power demand. To avoid these situations, the Markov chain model is proposed to predict the future power demand during a driving cycle. The optimal control problem is formulated as an equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS), that has to be solved by using the Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle. A Markov chain model is added as a separate block for a prediction of required power. This approach and the whole system are modeled and implemented using the MATLAB/Simulink. The model without Markov chain block and the model is with it are compared. The results presented demonstrate the importance of a Markov chain block added to a model.

                  In light of the current low energy-storage capacity of electric batteries, multi-speed transmissions (MSTs) are being considered for applications in electric vehicles (EVs), since MSTs decrease the energy consumption of the EV via gear-shifting. Nonetheless, swiftness and seamlessness are the major concerns in gear-shifting. This study focuses on developing a gear-shifting control scheme for a novel MST designed for EVs. The main advantages of the proposed MST are simplicity and modularity. Firstly, the dynamics model of the transmission is formulated. Then, a two-phase algorithm is proposed for shifting between each two gear ratios, which guarantees a smooth and swift shift. In other words, a separate control set is applied for shifting between each gear pair, which includes two independent PID controllers, tuned using trial-and-error and a genetic algorithm (GA), for the two steps of the algorithm and a switch. A supervisory controller is also employed to choose the proper PID gains, called PID gain-scheduling. Simulation results for various controllers and conditions are reported and compared, indicating that the proposed scheme is highly promising for a desired gear-shifting even in the presence of an unknown external disturbance.

                  Conventional all-electric vehicles (EV) adopt single-speed transmission due to its low cost and simple construction. However, with the adoption of this type of driveline system, development of EV technology leads to the growing performance requirements of drive motor. Introducing a multi-speed or two-speed transmission to EV offers the possibility of efficiency improvement of the whole powertrain. This paper presents an innovative two-speed Uninterrupted Mechanical Transmission (UMT), which consists of an epicyclic gearing system, a centrifugal clutch and a brake band, allowing the seamless shifting between two gears. Besides, driver׳s intention is recognized by the control system which is based on fuzzy logic controller (FLC), utilizing the signals of vehicle velocity and accelerator pedal position. The novel UMT shows better dynamic and comfort performance in compare with the optimized AMT with the same gear ratios. Comparison between the control strategy with recognition of driver intention and the conventional two-parameter gear shifting strategy is presented. And the simulation and analysis of the middle layer of optimal gearshift control algorithm is detailed. The results indicate that the UMT adopting FLC and optimal control method provides a significant improvement of energy efficiency, dynamic performance and shifting comfort for EV.

                  Controlled auto-ignition (CAI), also known as HCCI combustion has been researched extensively for gasoline engines due to their potential benefits of improved engine efficiency and low NOx emissions. One of the major challenges of typical CAI/HCCI combustion is to control the start and speed of combustion. In order to introduce some control over the heat release process of a premixed gasoline and air mixture, direct DME injection was exploited to enhance the mixture ignitability and control the combustion timing of the combustible mixture. The heat release rate and ignitability were also regulated by the internal exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). In this research, this was achieved and tested in a single cylinder gasoline port fuel injection engine by the use of Positive Valve Overlap (PVO) and direct DME injection via a commercial Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) injector. Three DME injection strategies, early single injection, split injection and late single injection, were applied to implement pure auto-ignition, hybrid combustion of flame assisted auto-ignition, and flame propagation, respectively, as the engine load increases. Stable combustion was achieved from 1.3bar net IMEP to 9.1bar net IMEP with 90% reduction in NOx emission than the SI combustion operation.

                  The large (26-fold over the past 25years) increase in the on-road vehicle fleet in China has raised sustainability concerns regarding air pollution prevention, energy conservation, and climate change mitigation. China has established integrated emission control policies and measures since the 1990s, including implementation of emission standards for new vehicles, inspection and maintenance programs for in-use vehicles, improvement in fuel quality, promotion of sustainable transportation and alternative fuel vehicles, and traffic management programs. As a result, emissions of major air pollutants from on-road vehicles in China have peaked and are now declining despite increasing vehicle population. As might be expected, progress in addressing vehicle emissions has not always been smooth and challenges such as the lack of low sulfur fuels, frauds over production conformity and in-use inspection tests, and unreliable retrofit programs have been encountered. Considering the high emission density from vehicles in East China, enhanced vehicle, fuel and transportation strategies will be required to address vehicle emissions in China.
                  We project the total vehicle population in China to reach 400–500 million by 2030. Serious air pollution problems in many cities of China, in particular high ambient PM2.5 concentration, have led to pressure to accelerate the progress on vehicle emission reduction. A notable example is the draft China 6 emission standard released in May 2016, which contains more stringent emission limits than those in the Euro 6 regulations, and adds a real world emission testing protocol and a 48-h evaporation testing procedure including diurnal and hot soak emissions. A scenario (PC[1]) considered in this study suggests that increasingly stringent standards for vehicle emissions could mitigate total vehicle emissions of HC, CO, NOX and PM2.5 in 2030 by approximately 39%, 57%, 59% and 79%, respectively, compared with 2013 levels. With additional actions to control the future light-duty passenger vehicle population growth and use, and introduce alternative fuels and new energy vehicles, the China total vehicle emissions of HC, CO, NOX and PM2.5 in 2030 could be reduced by approximately 57%, 71%, 67% and 84%, respectively, (the PC[2] scenario) relative to 2013. This paper provides detailed policy roadmaps and technical options related to these future emission reductions for governmental stakeholders.

                  Design of a controller that damps driveline oscillations, while compensating network-induced time-varying delays, can be a challenging problem considering that vehicle drivetrains are characterized by fast dynamics that are subject to physical and control constraints. As such, the goal of this paper is to provide a control design methodology that can cope with all these challenges and limitations and still yield an effective solution. To this end, firstly, a method for determining a worst case upper bound on the delays that can be introduced by a Controller Area Network (CAN) is presented. Then, a polytopic approximation technique is applied to obtain a discrete-time model of the closed-loop CAN system. Thirdly, a horizon-1 predictive controller based on flexible control Lyapunov functions is designed for the resulting model with polytopic uncertainty and hard constraints. Several tests performed on a benchmark model indicate that the proposed design methodology can handle both the performance/physical constraints and the strict limitations on the computational complexity.

                  Numerical study on the performance of the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell vehicle with variable operating pressure was conducted to investigate the effect of blower and backpressure control valve. We conducted system level modeling for PEM fuel cell vehicle to predict its performance, where the model is based on the commercial fuel cell vehicle manufactured by Hyundai-Kia Motors and thus is validated against the real driving data. We considered most parts of PEM fuel cell vehicle powertrain, i.e. blower, membrane humidifier, and backpressure control valve at cathode, hydrogen recirculation system using ejector at anode, and the system for refrigeration and air conditioning. In building such a large system model, most of the sub system models were developed based on either zero- or one-dimensional approach, but still capturing critical physical phenomena in each device. Among these components, we focused on the effect of blower and backpressure control valve in cathode side, since these are the main control parameters in the aforementioned vehicle to influence the operating characteristics of the fuel cell stack and thus the performance of the vehicle. From the system modeling results, as the rotation speed of the blower increases, the stoichiometric number for cathodic air becomes higher and the relative humidity becomes lower. When pressure is higher, power generation from stack is proportional to stoichiometric number, however, it has greatly influence on relative humidity, and the variation of system performance is similar to that of stack. In case of the backpressure control valve, the stoichiometric number is higher and the relative humidity is lower, when back pressure is low. This change begins to reduce system power. In the end, we developed the performance curve based on the blower RPM and the valve angle, at various vehicle speeds. The proposed performance curve could provide a useful means to understand overall operating characteristics of the fuel cell vehicle.

In case of the backpressure control valve, the stoichiometric number is higher and the relative humidity is lower, when back pressure is low. This change begins to reduce system power. In the end, we developed the performance curve based on the blower RPM and the valve angle, at various vehicle speeds. The proposed performance curve could provide a useful means to understand overall operating characteristics of the fuel cell vehicle.

                  This paper presents a novel braking torque distribution strategy for electric vehicles with four in-wheel motors equipped with the regenerative braking system. Safety and regeneration efficiency are the two major themes in the design of a regenerative braking system. Based on model predictive control (MPC) theory, the issues of multiple objectives and constraints of the regenerative braking system is well addressed. This proposed torque distribution controller can maximize the regeneration efficiency by determining the hydraulic braking torque and motor braking torque, which subject to the actuator constraints. Total braking torque of the four wheels tracks the braking requirement. Furthermore, in the case of ensuring brake safety, the braking torque of front and rear wheels are optimized to improve the possibility of energy recovery. The simulations have been conducted in Simulink environment based on an electric vehicle model established in AMESim software to verify the advantage of the proposed model predictive controller. In addition, the real-time test also demonstrates the effectiveness of the presented optimal control strategy.

                  In this investigation, an advanced modeling method, called online sequential extreme learning machine with a hyper-level fault tolerance-based supervisor (OSELM–FTS), is utilized to develop a robust safety-oriented autonomous cruise control based on the model predictive control (MPC) technique. The resulting MPC-based cruise controller is used to improve the driving safety and reduce the energy consumption of an electric vehicle (EV). The structural flexibility of OSELM–FTS allows us to not only improve the operating features of the EV, but also develop an intelligent supervisor which can detect any operating fault and send proper commands for the adaption of the MPC controller. This introduces a degree of robustness to the devised controller, as OSELM–FTS automatically detects and filters any operating faults which may undermine the performance of the MPC controller. To ascertain the veracity of the devised controller, three well-known MPC formulations, i.e. linear MPC (LMPC) and nonlinear MPC (NMPC) and diagonal recurrent neural network MPC (DRNN-MPC), are applied to the baseline EV and their performances are compared with OSELM–FTS-MPC. To further elaborate on the computational advantages of OSELM, a well-known chunk-by-chunk incremental machine learning approach, namely selective negative correlation learning (SNCL), is taken into account. The results of the comparative study indicate that OSELM–FTS-MPC is a very promising control scheme and can be reliably used for safety-oriented autonomous cruise control of the EVs.

                  In this paper, an appropriate control technique is investigated to reduce vibration and noise in switched reluctance motors (SRM). Vibrations are mainly caused by radial force acting on salient poles of the motor. In order to determine this force, a no linear model for switched reluctance motor is developed, based on finite element calculation of inductance and natural frequencies of stator. Thus, the force component at a frequency close to natural frequency of stator should be reduced. In this context, a method of two steps commutation is also applied. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the electro-mechanical-acoustic developed model makes possible to define theoretical spectrum of vibration and noise with conventional and proposed method. The simulation results showed that the proposed method performs better in terms of vibration and noise reduction.

As will be seen, the control problem considered in this work can be formulated as an optimization problem in the presence of several constraints. A systematic approach based on optimal control will be adopted to design the energy management strategies. Then, by means of these strategies, the electric energy will be generated and stored in the most appropriate manner so that the overall energy consumption and eventually the pollutant emissions can be minimized for a given driving cycle. To this end, both non-causal optimization method using the knowledge of the entire driving cycle and causal one are developed for two case studies with different structures of energy storage system.

                  In the context of ameliorating the electrical vehicle dynamic, this paper suggests an on-line control based on multi-objective Particle-Swarm-Optimization (MOPSO). This control is applied to Fuel Cell (FC)/Ultra-Capacitor (UC) vehicle in order to enhance the dynamic system and to reduce fuel consumption. The traction system, comprising a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) as well as the main power source and the auxiliary energy device, is controlled using PI controllers. The regulators’ gains are adjusted by an energy management system based on off-line PSO, in the first step and on-line MOPSO in the second one. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the two proposed approaches, a New York City cycle profile is implemented as the reference speed of the vehicle model. Theoretical analysis and outcomes display that the on-line self-adjusted PI regulators by MOPSO established on the Integral Absolute Error (IAE) index contributes better to the power management system than conventional regulators based on the same index.

                  In recent years, the effects of high-frequency current ripple coming from DC/DC converters on Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) have gained a growing interest from the international scientific community. Currently, the durability is one of the major technical challenges to PEMFC commercialization. Basing on the existing literature, the high-frequency current ripple leads up to long-term degradations on PEMFC, particularly on its lifetime. Accordingly, in order to enhance the PEMFC lifetime, new DC/DC converter topologies have been developed, such as Interleaved DC/DC Boost Converter (IBC). Despite this topology can minimize drastically the current ripple, the loss of one leg in case of power switch fault leads up to the drastic increasing of the current ripple and consequently long-term degradations on the PEMFC. In order to cope with this issue, solutions have to be developed. Within the framework of this research work, an efficient Fault-Tolerant Control (FTC) implemented on an FPGA board has been developed to solve this issue. The latter consists in changing the PWM gate control signal according to the faulty leg given by a fault detection algorithm. The obtained experimental results between a PEMFC and an IBC topology allows demonstrating the ability of the FTC to reduce drastically the current ripple in case of power switch faults.

                  Shifts in a dual-clutch transmission (DCT) are realized by torque transfer from one clutch to another without traction interruption due to the controlled slippage of the clutches. The timing of engagement and disengagement of the two clutches is critical for achieving a smooth shift without engine flare and clutch tie-up. This paper presents an analytical model for the simulation, analysis and control of shift dynamics for DCT vehicles. A dynamic model and the control logic for the integrated vehicle have been developed using Matlab/Simulink as the simulation platform. The model has been used to study the variation in output torque in response to different clutch pressure profiles during shifts. Optimized clutch pressure profiles have been created for the best possible shift quality based on model simulation. As a numerical example, the model is used for a DCT vehicle to simulate the wide-open throttle performance. Vehicle launch and shift process are both simulated to assess transmission shift quality and validate the effectiveness of the shift control.

                  Over the last two decades, significant research effort has been directed towards developing vehicle transmissions that reduce the energy consumption of an automobile. This effort has been a direct consequence of the growing environmental concern imposing the directives of reduced exhaust emissions and increased vehicle efficiency on current vehicle manufacturers and users. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) offers a continuum of gear ratios between desired limits, which consequently enhances the fuel economy and dynamic performance of a vehicle by better matching the engine operating conditions to the variable driving scenarios. Although a CVT plays a crucial role in the plan to improve vehicle fuel economy, its complete potential has not been realized in a mass-production vehicle. The current paper reviews the state-of-the-art research on dynamic modeling and control of friction-limited continuously variable transmissions. The basic concepts, mathematical models, and computational schemes are extensively discussed. Challenges and critical issues for future research on modeling and control of such CVTs are also discussed.

                  Battery thermal management is important for the safety and reliability of electric vehicle. Based on the parameters obtained from battery hybrid pulse power characterization test, a two-degree-of-freedom lumped thermal model is established. The battery model is then integrated with vehicle driving model to simulate real-time battery thermal responses. An active control method is proposed to reduce heat generation due to regenerative braking. The proposed control method not only subjects to the braking safety regulation, but also adjusts the regenerative braking ratio through a fuzzy controller. By comparing with other regenerative braking scenarios, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy has been validated. According to the results, the proposed control strategy suppresses battery temperature rise by modifying the charge current due to regenerative braking. The overlarge components of current are filtered out whereas the small ones are magnified. Therefore, with smaller battery temperature rise, more energy is recovered. Compared to the traditional passive heat dissipating, the proposed active methodology is feasible and provides a novel solution for electric vehicle battery thermal management.

                  Integrated Emission Management (IEM) is a supervisory control strategy that minimises operational costs (consisting of fuel and AdBlue) for diesel engines with an aftertreatment system, while satisfying emission constraints imposed by legislation. In most work on IEM, a suboptimal heuristic real-time implementable solution is used, which is based on Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP). In this paper, we compute the optimal solution using both PMP and Dynamic Programming (DP). As the emission legislation imposes a terminal state constraint, standard DP algorithms are sensitive to numerical errors that appear close to the boundary of the feasible sets. Therefore, we propose two extensions to existing DP methods, which use an approximation of the forward reachable sets to reduce the grid size over time and an approximation of the backward reachable sets to avoid the aforementioned numerical errors. Using a simulation study of a cold-start World Harmonised Transient Cycle for a Euro-VI engine, we show that the novel extension to the DP algorithm yields the best approximation of the optimal cost, when compared to existing DP methods. Furthermore, we show that PMP yields almost the same results as DP, and that the real-time implementable solution only deviates approximately 0.08–0.16% from the optimal solution.

                  The interaction between two active structural paths is analytically and experimentally studied as part of a resonating source-path-receiver system, where each path consists of a piezoelectric stack actuator in series with an elastomeric (passive) mount. An analytical model of the system is first developed, and then an experiment is constructed to verify the feasibility. Good agreement is found between the model and experiment. A performance index to characterize the active path interaction for source mass motion control up to 1000Hz is analytically defined; it considers the passive phase interaction (caused by system dynamics) between the active mounts and the resulting system motion. Two passive system parameters (rubber path structural damping and disturbance moment arm) emerge as key design variables that drastically change the performance index, and guidelines are developed for desirable path interactions. Limited experimental validation demonstrates that active source mass motion control is achieved at 400Hz using piezoelectric stack actuators.

                  The efficiency of electric vehicles (EVs) can be improved by applying multi-speed transmissions (MSTs), while ensuring that gear-shifting is swift and smooth. This paper establishes a gear-shifting control algorithm for a novel MST, with the advantages of simplicity and modularity, designed for EVs. Firstly, the mathematical model of the proposed MST is derived. Next, the control algorithm developed for gear-shifting is clarified, which guarantees seamlessness and swiftness. The system under study is over-actuated, with end constraints on some control inputs. Therefore, for acceleration and jerk continuity, while satisfying the input terminal constraints, one input is suggested to be changed independently, based on a 2-3 blending polynomial. Then, the new fully-actuated system is controlled using a linear quadratic integral (LQI) controller, which is an extension of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for tracking problems. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm in the presence of unknown external disturbances.

                  Fuel cell has been considered as one of the optimistic renewable power technologies for the automotive applications. The output power of a fuel cell is immensely dependent on cell temperature and membrane water content. Hence, a maximum power point tracking controller is essentially required to extract the optimum power from the fuel cell stack. In this paper, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system based maximum power point tracking controller is presented for 1.26 kW proton exchange membrane fuel cell system used in electric vehicle applications. In order to extract the optimum power, a high step-up boost converter is connected between the fuel cell and the BLDC motor. The duty cycle of the converter is controlled by using ANFIS reference model, so that the maximum power is delivered to the BLDC motor. The performance of the proposed controller is tested under normal operating conditions and also for sudden variations in the cell temperatures of the fuel cell. In addition to this, to analyze the effectiveness and tracking behaviour of the proposed controller, the results were compared with those obtained using the fuzzy logic controller. Compared to the fuzzy logic controller, the proposed ANFIS controller has increased the average DC link power by 1.95% and the average time taken to reach the maximum power point is reduced by 17.74%.

A model-predictive controller regulates the thermal comfort inside the tram as a master controller and outputs an auxiliary control variable to the slave controller. A heuristic, realised as mixed-integer optimisation, converts the auxiliary control variable in an energy-optimal way into switching commands for the HVAC. For validation, the method is implemented on a rapid controller prototyping platform. Testing of the control approach is done during several climatic wind tunnel measurements.

                  Recovering and converting the vehicular exhaust to mechanical or electrical energy using an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) is a hotspot in recent years. But due to the highly transient exhaust conditions in real driving cycles, how to control the ORC systems is still a big problem. In this paper, the dynamic, multi-modes, and coupling problems, which are obstacles for the ORC system control, are analyzed at first. Subsequently, a control structure, making some sort of compromise, is put forward, which focuses more on the system operation continuity, gain-loss balance, but not just pursuing the cycle efficiency optimality, wherein a systematic efficiency model, taking evaporating and condensing pressures as variables, is the heart. Seeing that the efficiency model is a binary nonlinear model, an order reduction method is presented to solve the model at an acceptable computational cost. Finally, control performances are demonstrated outstanding in the simulation on the Highway Fuel Economy Test (HWFET) cycle. Despite very transient exhaust gas conditions, the fluid before the turbine keeps always superheated 5 K-15 K. The power-production mode accounts for 94% of the whole duration, and undesirable start-stop procedures are fully avoided. The useful power coefficient achieves more than 80%.

Secondly, in terms of different decomposed layer subsystems, the constraint function and the weight factors of the corresponding mathematical models are established, and the elastic element parameters of the hierarchical fault levels are optimized with the appropriate matching improvement scheme. Thirdly, due to the linear parameter matching scheme of the cab mount not being obvious, a series of improved scaling weight factors and combined linear and nonlinear schemes are introduced based on an experimental design. Finally, by proposing an optimization criterion of maximum deviation degree, the optimal matching scheme is found through the interaction of information between the subsystem layers and part layers, obtaining the most suitable matching mode and damping scaling ratio for the part layer. The experimental results show the effect of proposed method and prove its advantages in countering vibration control problems.

The most challenging task on controlling a gasoline PPC engine is to regulate the maximum pressure rise rate to reduce engine noise and durability problem. A trade-off relationship between pressure rise rate and soot emissions is observed as a function of pilot injection event. In this paper, a control-oriented model is developed to predict in-cylinder pressure and engine outputs through fuel injection events. Thereafter, two controllers structured with PI and MPC are designed and evaluated separately. Simulation results show that, both controllers satisfy the objective of achieving desired engine load and combustion phasing, with the constraints of pressure rise rate and soot emissions simultaneously. MPC controller produces a smoother transient move with less overshoot, comparing with PI controller with a fast response.

                  Offshore container crane is a highly under-actuated nonlinear system whereas only two control inputs are employed for driving six system outputs. Controlling such a system is not easy since it faces with many challenges composed of actuator backlash, geometrical nonlinearities, seawater viscoelasticity, cable flexibility, strong wave and wind disturbances, and considerable lack of actuators. This article proposes a robust adaptive system for a ship-mounted container crane with the disadvantages mentioned above. The controller structure is constructed using second-order sliding mode control (SOSMC), and a modeling estimator is designed on the basis of radial basis function network (RBFN). While other adaptive control techniques only estimates system parameters, the adaptive RBFN algorithm approximates almost all the structure of a crane model, including system parameters. Simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the superiority of the proposed control system.

                  This paper establishes a coupled thermal model of the air conditioning system and cabin for electric vehicles, which considers the effects of solar radiation, vehicle speed, and the external environment on the heat exchanged with the cabin. An intelligent air conditioning system control strategy that can learn passengers’ thermal comfort preferences is proposed. This strategy predicts the preferred predicted mean vote of passengers by learning their thermal comfort preferences, then converts it into a target temperature for the air conditioning system. The performance of the proposed strategy is compared with that of conventional on-off and fuzzy PID controllers. In a simulated hot environment, the proposed control algorithm directly and automatically decreased the cabin temperature to the passengers’ preferred temperature without any manual adjustment. It can also maintain stable passenger PMVs and corresponding temperatures regardless of solar radiation, vehicle speed, and external environmental changes. The proposed strategy can improve the thermal comfort of passengers, compared with the on-off and fuzzy PID controllers; moreover, it consumes less energy. In a simulated driving cycle, its energy consumption was 31.8% less than that of the on-off controller and 10% less than that of the fuzzy PID controller, and its COP was respectively 20.4% and 18.7% more than those of on-off controller and the fuzzy PID controller. Therefore, the proposed strategy can make vehicles, especially electric ones, more efficient.

                  Traffic simulation is a cost-effective way to test the deployment of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) vehicles in a large-scale transportation network. By using a previously developed microscopic simulation testbed, this paper examines the impacts of four managed lane strategies for the near-term deployment of CACC vehicles under mixed traffic conditions. Network-wide performance measures are investigated from the perspectives of mobility, safety, equity, and environmental impacts. In addition, the platoon formation performance of CACC vehicles is evaluated with platoon-orientated measures, such as the percentage of platooned CACC vehicles, average platoon depth, and vehicle-hour-platooned that is proposed in this paper under the imperfect DSRC communication environment. Moreover, managed lane score matrices are developed to incorporate heterogeneous categories of performance measures, aiming to provide a more comprehensive picture for stakeholders. The results show that mixing CACC traffic along with non-CACC traffic across all travel lanes is an acceptable option when the market penetration (MP) is lower than 30% for roadways where a managed lane is absent. Providing CACC with priority access to an existing managed lane, if available, is also a good strategy for improving the overall traffic performance when the MP is lower than 40%. When the MP reaches above 40%, a dedicated lane for CACC vehicles is recommended, as it provides greater opportunity for CACC vehicles to form platoons. The facilitation of homogeneous CACC traffic flow could make further improvements possible in the future.

                  State feedback control is very attractive due to the precise computation of the gain matrix, but the implementation of a real-state feedback controller is impossible in most of the practical situations. Hence the need for an estimator or observer is obvious to estimate all the state variables by observing the input and the output of the controlled system. As such, the purpose of the paper is to provide a control design strategy based on a Luenberger observer that can assure the closed-loop performances of a vehicle drivetrain with backlash, while compensating the network-induced time-varying delays. The designed robust full state-feedback predictive controller based on flexible control Lyapunov functions explicitly takes into account the time-varying delays and guarantees also the input-to-state stability of the system in a non-conservative way. The control strategy was experimentally tested on a vehicle drivetrain emulator controlled through Controller Area Network.

                  In this paper, a combining sliding mode control (cSMC) approach of electric motor anti-lock braking system (emABS) is proposed to improve braking stability of battery electric vehicle (BEV). Two key variables, both wheel deceleration and slip ratio are utilized to design the emABS control law. Wheel deceleration directly characterizes the wheel speed, and slip ratio straightly characterizes some adhesion coefficient of ground. Based on sliding mode control (SMC) algorithm, two control laws of wheel deceleration and slip ratio are designed, the formula structures of which are very similar. At the same time, Lyapunov stability and robustness performance of the two control laws are proved, respectively. During the vehicle test, an interesting phenomenon was discovered that the SMC system of the wheel deceleration has fast transient response, and the slip ratio is more stability during stable control phase. The reason is that, the wheel deceleration can be measured accurately in the beginning, and the slip ratio can be computed accurately during stable control phase. Therefore, a SMC algorithm combined with wheel deceleration and slip ratio is designed for the control of emABS. With respect to low and high adhesion coefficient conditions, two simulation scenarios are utilized to validate the cSMC algorithm. In addition, the control strategy is verified on the test of BEV based on two road surfaces, the wet and the dry, respectively. These experimental results indicate that the proposed cSMC algorithm is a good candidate for the control of emABS.

                  There is a pressing need to address urban sustainability challenges of increasing ambient temperatures and noise levels in densely-populated, high-rise cities. Solutions that utilise active noise control on open windows to reduce indoor noise levels seem promising, as natural ventilation is still maintained. Active noise control utilizes acoustic transducers arranged around the open window to generate a secondary incidence noise that destructively interferes with the real noise. The two most common techniques of transducer arrangement, distributed and boundary layouts, are investigated for the typical single-glazed sliding window. Finite element method is used to establish the control performance of the active noise control system and the passive attenuation provided by the sliding window. Based on the investigated fundamental limits of active control, the distributed layout has consistently yielded better performance than the boundary layout. The distributed-layout method can also reduce noise more effectively than a fully-glazed window. Moreover, sources distributed only in the partial opening of a simulated sliding window can attenuate noise as effectively as the fully-glazed window. The distributed-layout method is tested on a full-sized window, where the active control system has up to 16 channels and evenly distributed across the window opening. In the test with tonal sounds, the feasibility of the active control system is demonstrated. The experimental results have validated the simulation findings for normal incidence plane waves.
               ","n sustainability challenges of increasing ambient temperatures and noise levels in densely-populated, high-rise cities. Solutions that utilise active noise control on open windows to reduce indoor noise levels seem promising, as natural ventilation is still maintained. Active noise control utilizes acoustic transducers arranged around the open window to generate a secondary incidence noise that destructively interferes with the real noise. The two most common techniques of transducer arrangement, distributed and boundary layouts, are investigated for the typical single-glazed sliding window. Finite element method is used to establish the control performance of the active noise control system and the passive attenuation provided by the sliding window.

                  A variable step-size median least-mean-square (VS-MLMS) algorithm, for active noise control (ANC) of rail vehicle interior noises is presented in this paper. Firstly, the interior noises of an urban rail vehicle under normal operating conditions are measured and analysed. Results show that the interior noise includes obvious impact noise components, and the sound energy of this noise is mainly concentrated in a low-frequency range below 1000 Hz. Utilising the measured interior noises, the adaptive filter order, median window length, and the optimal step size of the MLMS algorithm are determined. According to the step-size scope, the VS-MLMS algorithm is developed using a Sine step-size adjusting function. The MLMS, VS-MLMS and other algorithms are applied to the measured interior noise signals. Results suggest that the proposed VS-MLMS, which can balance the convergence speed and the steady-state error well, is more suitable for active control of a low-frequency noise with impact noise components. The VS-MLMS algorithm can be directly used in an ANC system of the sample urban rail vehicle, which is helpful to improve the ride comfort of the passengers.

                  The growing complexity of vehicle powertrain systems and stringent emissions requirements placed on these systems has necessitated the introduction of accurate and generalizable engine models that will be suitable for control and diagnostics. A first principle based control oriented model of a multi-cylinder gasoline engine is developed and shown to be also suitable for fault diagnosis. This model takes into cylinder-to-cylinder behavior and spatial orientation while maintaining a simple structure suitable for real time control. A model of the torque production mechanism is coupled with an analytical cylinder pressure model to capture the engine torque. The model of the torque production mechanism is derived using the Constrained Lagrangian Equation of Motion and simplified to a form suitable for integration in an overall engine model. The analytical cylinder pressure model is taken from literature and extended to a four cylinder engine. While it is common to model torque production subsystem as a continuously operating volumetric pump, the methods used in this work allow details including angular speed fluctuations of the crankshaft to be captured. In addition, the engine model is able to describe the dynamics of the system under faultless as well as faulty conditions, which is demonstrated for misfire. The proposed model is also leveraged for a novel fault tolerant control framework and is tuned and successfully validated for a

                  A nonlinear model predictive control approach is studied, for problems where a fixed terminal instant and corresponding terminal set to be reached are imposed. The new technique features a shrinking horizon, rather than the most common receding one, and an input parametrization strategy to reduce computational burden. The property of transferability of the parametrization strategy is introduced. Under this property, theoretical convergence guarantees in nominal conditions are obtained by construction. Two relaxed techniques are then proposed to retain recursive feasibility in presence of bounded additive input disturbance. A bound on the constraint violation achieved by these relaxed techniques as a function of the uncertainty bound is derived, too. The developed strategy is applied to the problem of energy-efficient operation of trains, in either a fully autonomous mode (with continuous input values) or a driver assistance mode (with discrete input values, resulting in a nonlinear integer program if no parametrization is used). Realistic simulation results in this context illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.

                  Fuel cells are powerful systems for power generation. They have a good efficiency and do not generate greenhouse gases. This technology involves a lot of scientific fields, which leads to the appearance of strongly inter-dependent parameters. This makes the system particularly hard to control and increases fault's occurrence frequency. These two issues call for the necessity to maintain the system performance at the expected level, even in faulty operating conditions. It is called “fault tolerant control” (FTC). The present paper aims to give the state of the art of FTC applied to the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). The FTC approach is composed of two parts. First, a diagnosis part allows the identification and the isolation of a fault; it requires a good a priori knowledge of all the possible faults. Then, a control part allows an optimal control strategy to find the best operating point to recover/mitigate the fault; it requires the knowledge of the degradation phenomena and their mitigation strategies.

                  In this article we analyze how passenger car transportation in Europe may change this century under permanent high oil prices and stringent climate control policy. We focus on electricity and hydrogen as principal candidate energy carriers, because these two options are increasingly believed to become the long-term competitors in the transport sector. We complement a concise stylistic analysis with an in-depth investigation performed with the energy system optimization model TIAM-ECN, which we ran only for the European regions for this study. This bottom-up model, belonging to the TIMES family, has been adapted for the purpose of researching – amongst others – the transport sector. We particularly inspect the use of passenger cars and find that, if oil prices amount to 100–150$/bl during the remainder of the century, the transport sector could be little affected in the sense that it may continue to rely predominantly on (liquid or gaseous) fossil fuels: our model suggests that it could be optimal to start replacing gasoline and diesel by natural gas around the middle of the century if sufficient oil and gas reserves are available within this price range. If the European Commission achieves implementing its ambitious carbon mitigation plan, however, a massive restructuring of the transport sector away from fossil fuels could take place, which in three decades would transform it to broadly rely on hydrogen as main energy carrier according to our model runs. Under a broad set of sensitivity scenarios with varying assumptions regarding our most important modeling parameters, we find that if battery costs are reduced by at least 60% in comparison to our reference cost decline path, the passenger car sector could predominantly run on electricity from around 2050.

                  The application of efficient variable output sub-systems for light, medium and heavy duty vehicle propulsion is a common pursuit in the interest of increasing engine performance and efficiency by decreasing parasitic losses. Many modern power steering pumps, automatic transmission and engine oil pumps, and air conditioning compressors provide variable output to meet variable load conditions independent of engine speed. Despite this trend, conventional cooling system pumps are not variable independent of engine speed and coolant flow is throttled by a conventional thermostat. The controllable variable flow (CVF) system described herein combines higher hydrodynamic pumping efficiency with thermally responsive integrated flow control capability thus exploiting the opportunity for fuel savings and lower emissions without requiring increased system complexity, materials, or space required.
               Comparative fuel economy and emissions testing on a first in-vehicle prototype confirmed 1.2% improved fuel economy plus measured emissions reductions relative to the series production pump and thermostat cooling system. The prototype system installed in a 3.0 litre V6 gasoline powered passenger vehicle has since completed 250,000km of all-season road testing trouble-free. This second paper on this topic reviews the technology, development, and vehicle testing results and also studies the attributes of this technology as applied to advanced internal combustion (IC) and new and emerging hybrid propulsion systems for light, medium and heavy vehicles applications. The hydrodynamic and operational principles, early development and prior test results have also been reported in an earlier paper by Fulton et. al. [1].

                  Recently, reduced order electrochemical models (ROMs) have been obtained more attention by industries for real-time applications. Its computational efficiency is maximized by regarding particles in electrodes as an equivalent single particle, named ROM-Single Particle Model (SPM). However, the model has a major drawback in the inaccuracy of the predicted terminal voltage, particularly at high currents. Therefore, an advanced ROM-SPM considering variable diffusivity (VD) of lithium ions in solid is proposed that significantly improves the accuracy of the terminal voltage, named as ROM-SPMVD.

                  Angular displacement sensor on the actuator of automated manual transmission (AMT) is sensitive to fault, and the sensor fault will disturb its normal control, which affects the entire gear-shifting process of AMT and results in awful riding comfort. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposes a method of fault-tolerant control for AMT gear-shifting engaging process. By using the measured current of actuator motor and angular displacement of actuator, the gear-shifting engaging load torque table is built and updated before the occurrence of the sensor fault. Meanwhile, residual between estimated and measured angular displacements is used to detect the sensor fault. Once the residual exceeds a determined fault threshold, the sensor fault is detected. Then, switch control is triggered, and the current observer and load torque table estimates an actual gear-shifting position to replace the measured one to continue controlling the gear-shifting process. Numerical and experiment tests are carried out to evaluate the reliability and feasibility of proposed methods, and the results show that the performance of estimation and control is satisfactory.

                  This work addresses the problem of robust tracking control for skid-steer mobile platforms, using tube-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control. The strategy seeks to mitigate the impact of disturbances propagated to autonomous vehicles originated by traction losses. To this end, a dynamical model composed by two coupled sub-systems stands for lateral and longitudinal vehicle dynamics and tire behavior. The controller is aimed at tracking prescribed stable operation points of the slip and side-slip beyond the robot pose and speeds. To reach robust tracking performance on the global system, a centralized control scheme operates under a predictive control framework composed by three control actions. The first one compensates for disturbances using the reference trajectory-feedforward control. The second control action corrects the errors generated by the modeling mismatch. The third one is devoted to ensure robustness on the closed-loop system whilst compensating for deviations of the state trajectories from the nominal ones (i.e. disturbance-free). The strategy ensures robust feasibility even when tightening constraints are met. Such constraints are calculated on-line based on robust positively invariant sets characterized by polytopic sets (tubes), including a terminal region to guarantee robustness. The benefits of the controller regarding tracking performance, constraint satisfaction and computational practicability were tested through simulations with a Cat® 262C skid-steer model. Then, in field tests, the controller evidenced high tracking accuracy against terrain disturbances when benchmarking performance with respect to inherent robust predictive controllers.

                  Despite the recent commercial success of hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles their market share is still insufficient to produce either a significant impact on energy consumption on a global basis or a profitable automotive segment. In this context, the possibility of upgrading conventional vehicles to hybrid electric vehicles is gaining increasing interest.
                  To this aim this paper investigated and modelled the intention to install an after-market hybridization solar-kit (HySolarKit) in order to ascertain the main behavioural determinants of the choice process and set up an operational model with which to estimate the market potential of such technology. In particular, two behavioural stages of the choice process were analysed and modelled: (i) the intention to adopt the HySolarKit; (ii) the choice to install the HySolarKit. Both issues were addressed through ad hoc stated preference surveys carried out in two different Italian cities, and through the specification and the calibration of discrete choice models based on the behavioural paradigm of random utility theory. Different modelling solutions (homoscedastic and heteroscedastic) were compared in terms of goodness-of-fit and sensitivity to level-of-service attributes. The results showed the technological potential of the HySolarKit, and that both behavioural stages may be effectively modelled through random utility theory. Estimation results allowed an interpretation of the main determinants of the investigated phenomena, making it possible to quantify the potential effects and the concerns towards such a green solution, and making it possible to draw up operative marketing strategies. In particular, the intention to adopt the kit mainly depends on socio-economic factors as well as activity-related and attitudinal attributes, whereas the probability of installing the kit is greatly affected, to the same extent, by installation cost, the charging cost and the weekly mileage driven.

Estimation results allowed an interpretation of the main determinants of the investigated phenomena, making it possible to quantify the potential effects and the concerns towards such a green solution, and making it possible to draw up operative marketing strategies. In particular, the intention to adopt the kit mainly depends on socio-economic factors as well as activity-related and attitudinal attributes, whereas the probability of installing the kit is greatly affected, to the same extent, by installation cost, the charging cost and the weekly mileage driven.

                  With the increasing penetration of distributed renewable energy generation and dynamic electricity pricing schemes, applications for residential demand side management are becoming more appealing. In this work, we present an optimal control model for studying the economic and grid interaction benefits of smart charging of electric vehicles (EV), vehicle-to-grid, and space heating load control for residential houses with on-site photovoltaics (PV). A case study is conducted on 1–10 net zero energy houses with detailed empirical data, resulting in 8–33% yearly electricity cost savings per household with various electric vehicle and space heating system combinations. The self-consumption of PV is also significantly increased.
                  Additional benefits through increasing the number of cooperating households are minor and saturate already at around 3–5 households. Permitting electricity transfer between the houses and EV charging stations at workplaces increases self-sufficiency significantly, but it provides limited economic benefit. The additional cost savings from vehicle-to-grid compared to smart charging are minor due to increased battery degradation, despite a significant self-sufficiency increase. If the optimization is conducted without taking the battery degradation cost into account, the added monetary value of vehicle-to-grid can even be negative due to the unmanaged degradation. Neglecting battery degradation completely leads to overestimation of the vehicle-to-grid cost benefit.

                  This paper presents a model-based control scheme to the cold-start speed control in spark ignition (SI) engines. The multi-variable control algorithm is developed with the purpose of improving the transient performance of the starting engine speed: the control inputs are the fuel injection, the throttle and the spark advance (SA), while the engine speed and the air mass flow rate are the measured signals. The fuel injection is performed with a dual sampling rate system: the cycle-based fuel injection command is individually adjusted for each cylinder by using a TDC (top dead center)-based air charge estimation. The desired performance for speed regulation is achieved by using a coordinated control of SA and throttle operation. The speed error convergence of the closed loop system is proved for simplified, second-order model with a time-delay, and the robustness with respect to parameter uncertainties is investigated. The performance and the robustness with respect to modeling uncertainties of the proposed control scheme are tested using an industrial engine simulator with six cylinders.

                  Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion engines are advantageous in terms of good fuel economy and low levels of soot-nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. However, they are accompanied with some intrinsic challenges, the most important of which is the lack of any direct control method for ignition trigger. Thus, implementation of HCCI combustion is in fact a control problem, and an optimized control structure is required for attaining the inherent benefits of HCCI. The control structure consists of a proper representation of engine processes; a suitable selection of state variables; useful and applicable set of inputs, outputs and observers; appropriate fixed or variable set-points for controlled parameters; instrumentations including sensors and actuators; and an applicable control law implemented in a controller. The present paper aims at addressing these issues altogether by introducing HCCI engine control structure in progress and presenting highlights from literature. Research should result in appropriately controlled HCCI engines which can provide desired load at rated speed with acceptable performance and emissions characteristics.

Based on stochastic system techniques, a series of sufficient conditions for the existence of the observer-based controller are given in the form of backward recursive Riccati Difference Equations (RDE). A controller–estimator design algorithm is derived to determine the controller and observer gains with which the disturbance of the preceding vehicle acceleration can be eliminated and string stability and zero steady-state velocity error performance can be guaranteed.

This paper presents an algorithm for utilities to identify optimal scenarios for controlling electric load of plug-in electric vehicles on a neighborhood transformer, and their potential contribution to reducing overloading through controlled charging and feeding power back to the grid. A dataset of real-world driving data of 2800 vehicles in Canada is used to emulate realistic driving patterns for the simulations. The electric load of vehicles charging is estimated for different charging scenarios, battery capacities, and numbers of electric vehicle. Operational energy consumption data of single-family homes are used to predict realistic power profiles of a residential neighborhood. Different scenarios of controlling the electric load on a pole transformer are investigated for two seasons to account for ambient temperatures.

Results show that vehicle-to-grid is an effective measure to reduce peak loads, while climate condition, vehicle penetration rate, and driving profile are the key factors to the control strategies.

                  In a typical operation mode, a wheel loader frequently accelerates and decelerates, and the curvature of the driving path is inconsistent. In the past, autonomous vehicle trajectory planning has not considered the related changes in the velocity of the vehicle. Therefore, the trajectory tracking control process has seldom considered the impact of curving paths on the trajectory tracking performance. To address these problems, this study evaluated an autonomous wheel loader based on the trajectory of its non-uniform driving motion and constructed an adaptive model predictive control (AMPC) trajectory tracking system that considers disturbances in the path curvature. The trajectory of the autonomous wheel loader was then tracked using the proposed AMPC system with a planned non-uniform motion trajectory as the target. Its performance was then compared with that of a conventional model predictive control (MPC) trajectory tracking system that does not consider any path curvature disturbances. The maximum displacement error and heading error obtained by the proposed AMPC system were found to be 65.7% and 60%, respectively, smaller than those obtained by the MPC system. The desired trajectory can also be tracked well under different curvature amplitudes using the AMPC trajectory tracking system, ensuring active safety performance of an autonomous wheel loader in the process of trajectory tracking.

                  Driveability is an important attribute of the road vehicles. Driveline oscillations caused by load changes in the driveline are deteriorating driveability of the vehicle and may cause discomfort by the driver. Load changes in the driveline may occur during tip-in and tip-out manoeuvres or during gear changes. Controllers that reduce driveline oscillations have to balance the trade-off between performance feel and comfort. Therefore, the controller needs to assess the driver expectation and needs to have a metric for the target vehicle response accordingly. An optimal controller structure is designed with different cost functions to be effective in different driving modes. To switch between modes, a mode selector state machine is designed. In order to ensure that the trade-off is done correctly, a tip-in detection algorithm is implemented. Desired response of the vehicle is ensured via an acceleration set point generator. The effectiveness of the controller is shown with simulation results.

                  This paper deals with the experimental testing of a bottoming Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) integrate in a 2l turbocharged gasoline engine using ethanol as working fluid. The main components of the cycle are a boiler, a condenser, a pump and a swash-plate expander. Both steady and transient tests were performed in three engine operating points to understand the behavior and inertia of the system. Pressure-Volume diagram during these transients were presented and analyzed. Operating parameters of the expander, such as expander speed and boiler power, were shifted. The objective of these tests is to understand the inertia of the system and to have a robust control in all the possible transient tests. New European Driving Cycle was tested with and without the expander because it is supposed to represent the typical usage of a car in Europe. It was used to validate the control of the ORC in realistic dynamic conditions of the engine. The importance of each parameter was analyzed by fixing all the parameters, changing each time one specific value. The main result of this paper is that using a slightly simple and robust control based on adaptive PIDs, the two dynamic effects of an ORC could be taken into account, i.e. high inertia effects (boiler and condenser) and low inertia effects (pump and volumetric expander).

                  This work aims at extending some concepts of symbolic control design to decentralized control structures, with an approximate simulation approach. Symbolic models and controllers are based on abstractions of continuous dynamics where one symbol corresponds to an aggregate of continuous states. We consider a serial interconnection of continuous nonlinear systems and we address the decentralized design of local controllers to accomplish a given specification on the overall system. The results are applied to a vehicle platooning problem, where we jointly fulfill a safety constraint (collision avoidance) and reduce the fuel consumption.

                  Based on a detailed introduction of the working principle and starting process of a new power-cycling continuously variable transmission (PCVT), a starting dynamic model of the system is established. According to its special structure and the characteristics of power reflux, pure-throttle and first-gear-clutch starting controls are proposed. Pure-throttle starting control of PCVT can realize accurate throttle control in stages, by using start time and jerk as control objectives and combining them with driver starting intentions. The clutch-starting control takes the jerk, friction work, and starting time as control objectives. Furthermore, its control strategy of the clutch-oil pressure change rate is formulated in stages, combined with driver starting intentions. To achieve the optimal starting performance, an optimization method is proposed, based on the analytic hierarchy process and genetic algorithm. Simulation results show that the two strategies can effectively guarantee the quality of vehicle starting with consideration of driver intentions. After optimization, the starting jerk is effectively reduced by 36.6% in the pure-throttle starting mode and 34.2% in the first-gear-clutch starting mode.

This control design framework offers, in addition to constraint satisfaction, also the possibility of including an optimization objective that can be used to minimize steady state (tracking) errors, to decrease the settling time, to reduce overshoot and so on.

                  A transmission belt deals with non-linear phenomena such as parametric excitations that can bring the belt in an instability region resulting in large transverse oscillations. These oscillations can cause belt life deflection, noise and unexpected vibration on its environment. The present study proposes a new strategy to control oscillations of a transmission belt subject to periodic tension fluctuations. Indeed, for a transmission belt, periodic torque fluctuations cause periodic belt tension fluctuations which can be a source of excitation for the belt and resulting in belt oscillations under certain conditions. The presence of a clutch between the belt end-point and the source of torque fluctuations offers a means to clip torque fluctuations and thus to clip belt excitation. In keeping with this notion, belt oscillations can be controlled by an Excitation Clipping using Clutch Clamping Control (E4C) strategy. Through an example of a transmission belt subject to periodic tension fluctuations, the E4C strategy is presented and a new analytical model of belt behavior with its E4C strategy is constructed. Free belt oscillations (E4C is not activated) and controlled belt oscillations (E4C is activated) are observed through an experimental setup and predicted owing to the new analytical model. Finally, the E4C strategy leads to frequency unlocking that successfully removes belt oscillations. This new analytical model furthermore provides an accurate prediction of belt behavior with its E4C strategy.

                  The basic function of any type of automotive transmission is to transfer the engine torque to the vehicle with the desired ratio smoothly and efficiently and the most common control devices inside the transmission are clutches and hydraulic pistons. The automatic control of the clutch engagement plays a crucial role in Automatic Manual Transmission (AMT) vehicles, being seen as an increasingly important enabling technology for the automotive industry. It has a major role in automatic gear shifting and traction control for improved safety, drivability and comfort and, at the same time, for fuel economy. In this paper, a model for a wet clutch actuated by an electro-hydraulic valve used by Volkswagen for automatic transmissions is presented. Starting from the developed model, a simulator was implemented in Matlab/Simulink and the model was validated against data obtained from a test-bench provided by Continental Automotive Romania, which includes the Volkswagen wet clutch actuated by the electro-hydraulic valve. Then, a predictive control strategy is applied to the model of the electro-hydraulic actuated clutch with the aims of controlling the clutch piston displacement and decreasing the influence of the network-induced delays on the control performances. The simulation results obtained with the proposed method are compared with the ones obtained with different networked controllers and it is shown that the strategy proposed in this paper can indeed improve the performances of the control system.

It is assumed that the plant has no right half plane zeros and the delay is known. The adaptive controller is based on the Smith Predictor and Finite Spectrum Assignment with time-varying parameters adjusted online. A novel Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional is used to show semi-global stability of the closed-loop error equations. The controller is applied to engine fuel-to-air ratio control. The implementation results show that the Adaptive Posicast Controller significantly improves the closed-loop performance when compared to the case with the existing baseline controller.

                  Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) provide new opportunities to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emission. PEVs need to draw and store energy from an electrical grid to supply propulsive energy for the vehicle. As a result, it is important to know when PEVs batteries are available for charging and discharging. Furthermore, battery energy management and control is imperative for PEVs as the vehicle operation and even the safety of passengers depend on the battery system. Thus, scheduling the grid power electricity with parking lots would be needed for efficient charging and discharging of PEV batteries. This paper aims to propose a new intelligent battery energy management and control scheduling service charging that utilize Cloud computing networks. The proposed intelligent vehicle-to-grid scheduling service offers the computational scalability required to make decisions necessary to allow PEVs battery energy management systems to operate efficiently when the number of PEVs and charging devices are large. Experimental analyses of the proposed scheduling service as compared to a traditional scheduling service are conducted through simulations. The results show that the proposed intelligent battery energy management scheduling service substantially reduces the required number of interactions of PEV with parking lots and grid as well as predicting the load demand calculated in advance with regards to their limitations. Also it shows that the intelligent scheduling service charging using Cloud computing network is more efficient than the traditional scheduling service network for battery energy management and control.

                  Uptake of electric vehicles (EVs) by consumers could reduce CO2 emissions from light duty road transport, but little is known about how mass-market consumer drivers will respond to them. Self-Congruity theory proposes that products are preferred whose symbolic meanings are congruent with personal identity. Further, Construal Level theory suggests that only those who are psychologically close to a new product category through direct experience with it can make concrete construals related to their lifestyles; most drivers lack this for EVs. For instance, potential performance benefits of EVs might offset range limitations for consumers who have such direct experience. The effect of direct experience was tested in a randomised controlled trial with 393 mass-market consumer drivers. An experimental group were given direct experience of a modern battery electric vehicle (BEV), and a control group an equivalent conventional car. Despite rating the performance of the BEV more highly than that of the conventional car, willingness to consider a BEV declined after experience, particularly if the range of the BEV considered was short. The participants willing to consider a short-range BEV were those high in self-congruity, for whom the BEV could act as a strong symbol of personal identity.

                  Utilizing model-based controller design in automotive and powertrain industry is recently attracting more attention due to its benefits in reducing controller development time and cost. Recent automotive emission legislations put more limits on engine emissions in transients. Hence, the models, which are capable of predicting engine performance and emissions in transient, are of the utmost importance. On the other hand, the model-based controller design requires accurate meanwhile fast to run models to be employed in both controller development and subsequent hardware in loop processes. In this paper, a new quasi-static control oriented diesel engine modeling approach is investigated based on the block oriented modeling method to predict the engine behavior in sense of both performance and emissions in transient and steady state operation. The accuracy and speed of model execution are two important attributes of models, which are in mutuality. In the proposed modeling a tradeoff between these two factors are made and some solutions are employed to increase both model accuracy and speed. The diesel engines are nonlinear dynamic systems. In the proposed modeling approach, this behavior is assumed to be composed of a semi-static combustion process surrounded by peripheral dynamic processes. This static in cylinder process model is responsible for the performance and emissions of the engine. Thermodynamic modeling coupled with chemical reaction model altogether with 1D gas dynamic model is employed to predict the performance and emission of in-cylinder process based on some boundary conditions which are derived from peripheral systems. Usually an iterative time consuming method is employed to solve the thermodynamic models. In order to decrease the run-time of model, a neural network is trained to mimic the thermodynamic model. On the other hand ordinary time differential equations are used to model the peripheral dynamic systems such as induction and exhaust systems. In order to validate the model for both steady and transient regimes, real step responses as well as experimental frequency response are compared with model results. The comparison of experimental data with model results shows tight agreement in both performance and emission prediction capabilities.

                  Pantograph current collectors, especially for high-speed trains, need to ensure safe contact with the catenary under stringent requirements on the dynamic contact force. A novel, high-dynamic pantograph test rig with accurate virtual catenary emulation is presented that allows for efficient, realistic, and reproducible testing. The complex dynamics of the pantograph/catenary interaction is modeled by a real-time-capable distributed-parameter description in moving coordinates. The proposed test rig controller incorporates model-predictive impedance control to match the desired catenary dynamics. Additionally, it keeps the exchange of the conserved quantities energy and momentum between the real pantograph and the virtual catenary consistent to increase physical trustworthiness of the results, even in high-dynamic test scenarios. The proposed methods are experimentally validated on the full-scale pantograph test rig.

                  With the increase of wind power capacity worldwide, researchers are focusing their attention on the operation and maintenance of wind turbines. A proper pitch controller must be designed to extend the life cycle of a wind turbine’s blades and tower. The pitch control system has two primaries, but conflicting, objectives: to maximize the wind energy captured and converted into electrical energy and to minimize fatigue and mechanical load. Four metrics have been proposed to balance these two objectives. Also, diverse pitch controller strategies are proposed in this paper to evaluate these objectives. This paper proposes a novel metrics approach to achieve the conflicting objectives with a maintenance focus. It uses a 100 kW wind turbine as a case study to simulate the proposed pitch control strategies and evaluate with the metrics proposed.

                  The production of electricity and hydrogen in a renewable fashion, such as using solar energy, can provide a clean and sustainable energy source for electric-powered vehicles, including fuel-cell and battery-electric vehicles. Our research on generating hydrogen and charging batteries using renewable solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity has led to the development of a simple and convenient new metric called the coupling factor that describes the fraction of the maximum PV power transferred to electrical loads. The keystone of the coupling factor concept is a regression model to calculate the maximum PV voltage, current, and power as a function of the instantaneous incident solar irradiance and the photovoltaic module temperature. The coupling factor can range from zero to one, i.e., no transfer of power from the PV system to the load, to complete transfer of the PV power. We describe the derivation of regression models to compute important PV electrical output variables, such as the open circuit voltage, the short circuit current, the maximum power point voltage, the maximum power point current, and the coupling factor as a function of the fundamental measured variables affecting those quantities. The models are derived for PV modules used in our previous research to power an electrolyzer and charge high-voltage batteries. In addition, we develop models for other modules using PV cell technologies different from those used in our PV system. Some of the calculated quantities are compared to measurements for our PV system. The usefulness of these quantities, and especially the coupling factor, in rating the transfer of PV power to electrolyzer and battery loads, is illustrated. Finally, we discuss how the predicted maximum power point voltage can be used for real-time control and efficiency optimization of a dynamic PV-load system.

                  In recent years sophisticated technologies have been developed to control vehicle speed based on the type of road the vehicle is driven on using Global Positioning Systems and in-car technology that can alter the speed of the vehicle. While reducing the speed of road vehicles is primarily of interest from a safety perspective, vehicle speed is also an important determinant of vehicle emissions and thus these technologies can be expected to have impacts on a range of exhaust emissions. This work analyses the results from a very large, comprehensive field trial that used 20 instrumented vehicles with and without speed control driven almost 500,000 km measuring vehicle speed at 10 Hz. We develop individual vehicle modal emissions models for CO2 for 30 Euro III and Euro IV cars at a 1-Hz time resolution. Generalized Additive Models were used to describe how emissions from individual vehicles vary depending on their driving conditions, taking account of variable interactions and time-lag effects. We quantify the impact that vehicle speed control has on-vehicle emissions of CO2 by road type, fuel type and driver behaviour. Savings in CO2 of ≈6% were found on average for motorway-type roads when mandatory speed control was used compared with base case conditions. For most other types of road, speed control has very little effect on emissions of CO2 and in some cases can result in increased emissions for low-speed limit urban roads. We also find that there is on average a 20% difference in CO2 emission between the lowest and highest emitting driver, which highlights the importance of driver behaviour in general as a means of reducing emissions of CO2.

                      emission legislations for Diesel engines are becoming more stringent than ever before. Since catalyst aging has a significant impact on SCR performance, robust and adaptive SCR control has been preferred for degraded SCR systems to realize emission control objectives. The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, a robust ammonia coverage ratio observer was designed for estimating the ammonia coverage ratio reference for catalysts with different aging levels. An ammonia storage capacity observer was developed for estimating the actual ammonia storage capacity which can be reduced due to catalyst aging. An adaptive ammonia coverage ratio reference design was then developed to estimate the desired ammonia coverage ratio ranges at each instantaneous engine operating point for both single-cell and two-cell SCR systems at different aging levels based on a singular perturbation method. Secondly, to ensure the estimated ammonia coverage ratio falls in the desired ranges for most of engine operating conditions, robust nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) algorithms were designed for both single-cell and two-cell SCR systems. Experimental data over US06 cycle were collected from a Diesel engine and aftertreatment system platform for controller verification. Simulation results under US06 test cycle demonstrate that the proposed NMPC algorithms were capable of consistently achieving high NO

Since catalyst aging has a significant impact on SCR performance, robust and adaptive SCR control has been preferred for degraded SCR systems to realize emission control objectives. The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, a robust ammonia coverage ratio observer was designed for estimating the ammonia coverage ratio reference for catalysts with different aging levels. An ammonia storage capacity observer was developed for estimating the actual ammonia storage capacity which can be reduced due to catalyst aging. An adaptive ammonia coverage ratio reference design was then developed to estimate the desired ammonia coverage ratio ranges at each instantaneous engine operating point for both single-cell and two-cell SCR systems at different aging levels based on a singular perturbation method. Secondly, to ensure the estimated ammonia coverage ratio falls in the desired ranges for most of engine operating conditions, robust nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) algorithms were designed for both single-cell and two-cell SCR systems. Experimental data over US06 cycle were collected from a Diesel engine and aftertreatment system platform for controller verification. Simulation results under US06 test cycle demonstrate that the proposed NMPC algorithms were capable of consistently achieving high NO

               This chapter provides a history of fuel cells focusing on the main types of fuel cells, their characteristics and development status and discusses the thermodynamics and the process engineering aspects of fuel-cell systems. Fuel cells are described by their electrolyte: alkaline–AFC, phosphoric acid–PAFC, solid polymer–SPFC, molten carbonate–MCFC, and solid oxide–SOFC. The prime source of hydrogen for fuel cells is by reforming a hydrocarbon, particularly natural gas. The hydrogen production can be carried out either at a central large-scale facility, or immediately upstream of the fuel cell, including on board for transport applications. Steam methane reforming is the main commercially applied process for hydrogen production. The alkaline fuel cell has the advantages of using cheap materials; is quick to start and has high power density. The main disadvantages are the corrosive electrolyte and the intolerance to carbon dioxide. The phosphoric acid fuel cell has CO2 tolerance. Cost of the noble metal catalyst is a problem for the rest of the cell types. A fuel cell converts the Gibbs free energy of a chemical reaction into a stream of electrons under isothermal conditions. This chapter discusses the engineering role in the development of a practical fuel cell system. There are two advantages to the hydrogen economy: if early hydrogen-fuelled vehicles are not very efficient it does not matter because pollution-wise they have zero emissions, and more importantly, the existing cost of expensive exhaust after-treatment is removed. The chapter reviews the problems of package layout for all the electric vehicles.

                  On the basis of improving drivability and efficiency, an electric vehicle equipped with automatic manual transmission is a considerable framing. However, the conventional geared transmissions usually install automated clutch which require the hydraulic power in addition to the slippage in the clutch plate invoking some energy loss as well as wear. For this reason, a practical approach with respect to clutchless automatic manual transmission (CLAMT) and its gear-shifting control strategy for an electric vehicle was proposed by our research team. In order to determine the key factors affecting the gear-shifting operation of CLAMT, a dynamic model of the CLAMT driveline was developed and the dynamic characteristics of the transmission synchronizer during each gear-shifting phase were analyzed in this paper. The analysis indicates that the gear-shifting operation of CLAMT not only requires a power motor with the capability of rapid mode-switching and precise speed regulation, but also demands that the shift actuators have the ability of exact position adjustment and strong robustness against shift load variations. To realize rapid and accurate gear-shifting control, the key technique relating to the robust position control scheme for the gear-shifting actuators were described in detail and validated on a designed CLAMT test rig.

The investigated parameter/state uncertainties include the tire cornering stiffness, vehicle mass, and vehicle longitudinal velocity. The unmodeled terms in the vehicle lateral dynamics model are dealt as the external disturbances. Faults of the active steering system and in-wheel motors can cause dangerous consequences for driving, and are considered in the control design. Input saturation issues for the tire forces can deteriorate the control effects, and are handled by the proposed strategy. Integrated control with active front steering (AFS) and direct yaw moment (DYC) is adopted to control the vehicle yaw rate and sideslip angle simultaneously. Simulation results based on a high-fidelity and full-car model via CarSim-Simulink show the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.

                  This paper deals with the problem of damping driveline oscillations, which is crucial to improving driveability and passenger comfort. Recently, this problem has received an increased interest due to the introduction in several production vehicles of the dual-clutch powershift automatic transmission with dry clutches. This type of transmission improves fuel economy, but it results in a challenging control problem, due to driveline oscillations. These oscillations, also called “shuffles”, occur during gear-shift, while traversing backlash or when tip-in and tip-out maneuvers are performed. The contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that horizon-1 model predictive control based on flexible Lyapunov functions and piecewise affine drivetrain models with three inertias provides an effective solution to driveline oscillation damping. Several simulations based on realistic scenarios show that the proposed control scheme can handle both the performance and physical constraints, and the strict limitations on the computational complexity.

All sources are paralleled together with their associated DC-DC converters on a common DC- link coupled to vehicle’s electrical motor and its converter. DC-link voltage must be regulated in spite of load power variations corresponding the driving cycle. A reduced LPV controller is obtained using the ISTIA algorithm. It shows to have a special form consistent with the physical properties of the studied system. The MIMO LPV reduced controller is proved to ensure quadratic stability of the closed-loop system.

                  An innovative zero-dimensional predictive combustion model has been developed for the estimation of HRR (heat release rate) and in-cylinder pressure traces. This model has been assessed and applied to conventional and PCCI (premixed charge compression ignition) DI diesel engines for model-based feed-forward control purposes.
                  The injection rate profile is calculated on the basis of the injected fuel quantities and on the injection parameters, such as SOI (start of injection), ET (energizing time), and DT (dwell time), taking the injector NOD (nozzle opening delay) and NCD (nozzle closure delay) into account. The injection rate profile in turn allows the released chemical energy Qch
                      to be estimated. The approach starts from the assumption that, at each time instant, the HRR is proportional to the energy associated with the accumulated fuel mass in the combustion chamber. The main novelties of the proposed approach consist of the method that is adopted to estimate the fuel ignition delay and of injection rate splitting for HRR estimation. The procedure allows an accurate calculation to be made of the different combustion parameters that are important for engine calibration, such as SOC (start of combustion) and MFB50 (50% of fuel mass fraction burned angle).
                  On the basis of an estimation of the fuel released chemical energy, of the heat globally exchanged from the charge with the walls and of the energy associated with the fuel evaporation, the charge net energy is calculated, for a subsequent evaluation of the in-chamber pressure during combustion, through the inversion of a single-zone combustion model, using a specifically optimized correlation for the isentropic coefficient γ. Polytropic evolutions are considered to simulate the in-cylinder pressure traces during the compression and expansion phases. The pressure calculation allows different combustion parameters, such as the peak firing pressure and the indicated mean effective pressure, to be evaluated.
                  The model parameters have been calibrated on a GMPT-E (general motors powertrain Europe) PCCI 1.9l diesel engine, equipped with solenoidal injectors, over a wide range of steady-state operating conditions, both at medium–low and at medium–high loads/speeds, for different values of the engine compression ratio and for different EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) rates. Physically consistent correlations have been found over the whole engine map with reference to the most influential parameters of the model. The application of the model has shown very promising results and a low computational time.

                  In this paper, the problem of adaptive fuzzy quantized output-feedback control is investigated for a class of uncertain switched nonlinear systems in strict feedback form. The considered switched systems contain unknown nonlinearities, hysteretic quantized input and without requiring the system states being available for measurement. Fuzzy logic systems are utilized to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, and a switched fuzzy state observer is designed to estimate the unmeasured states. The hysteretic quantized input is implemented to avoid the oscillation caused by logarithmic quantizer and decomposed into two bounded nonlinear functions. Based on the estimated states and using the backstepping design principle, an adaptive fuzzy quantized output feedback control scheme is developed. It is proved that whole adaptive fuzzy quantized control scheme can guarantee that all the variables in the closed-loop system are bounded under a class of switching signals with average dwell time, and also that the system output can track a given reference signal as closely as possible. The simulation results are given to check the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

                  An overview is presented of laboratory and vehicle studies conducted at Ford Motor Company on the LNT+in situ SCR catalyst approach to diesel emissions control. Specifically, the paper focuses on results obtained with so-called “2nd-generation” systems developed by Ford's catalyst suppliers since 2007–2008. These systems are characterized by improvements in durability, performance and cost relative to their predecessors. Key features of the 2nd-generation LNT+in situ SCR technology include: (1) lower desulfation temperatures of the LNT, (2) lower LNT platinum group metal (PGM) content than required for LNT-only systems, (3) advanced SCR catalysts of the types used in commercial zeolite-based SCR applications, (4) synergetic coupling of the LNT and SCR catalyst performance to maintain high efficiency after aging, (5) a non-ammonia NOx reduction mechanism over the SCR catalyst in addition to the standard mechanism based on ammonia storage, and (6) improved hydrocarbon oxidation efficiency owing to the SCR catalyst. Taken together, these advances improve the prospect of meeting future emission regulations on light-duty diesel vehicles, but not without considerable challenge to both the aftertreatment system and control strategy for achieving simultaneous low NOx and non-methane hydrocarbon emissions while minimizing fuel consumption.

                  This work deals with relaxed conditions for stability and stabilization of discrete-time Takagi–Sugeno (TS) models. It recalls classical results found in the literature which use quadratic Lyapunov functions leading to very conservative conditions, and various extensions based on piecewise and non-quadratic Lyapunov functions. Afterwards, a new and powerful way to enhance the previous results is depicted. The basic idea is that waiting long enough a stable model will converge towards its equilibrium and, therefore, the Lyapunov functions under consideration are not necessarily decreasing at every sample, but are allowed to decrease every k samples. Whatever it is k >1, the results are proved to include the standard one-sample case. The potential of this approach is shown through several examples in the paper.

                  The problem of path following for marine surface vessels using the rudder angle is addressed in this paper. A four-degree-of-freedom nonlinear surface vessel model, together with the Serret–Frenet equations, is introduced to describe the ship dynamics and path following error dynamics. While similar models have been used and reported in the literature for path following control algorithm development, the novelty of the approach presented in this work lies in the following aspects. (a) The back-stepping nonlinear controller design is based on feedback dominance, instead of feedback linearization and nonlinearity cancelation; (b) additional design parameters are employed in the Lyapunov function that lead to simplification of the controller in the design procedure and normalization of different variables in the Lyapunov function to improve the controller performance; (c) relying on feedback dominance and the introduction of the additional parameters in the Lyapunov function, the resulting controller is almost linear, with very benign nonlinearities allowing for analysis and evaluation; and (d) the performance of the nonlinear controller, in terms of path following, is analyzed for robustness in the presence of model uncertainties. The simulation results are presented to verify and illustrate the analytic development and the effectiveness of the resulting control against rudder saturation and rate limits, and delays in the control execution, as well as measurement noises. Furthermore, the control design is validated by experimental results conducted in a tank using a model ship.

                  This paper will compare and contrast two apparently different approaches for representing linguistic fuzzy algorithms as well as discussing their relevance to neurofuzzy adaptive modelling and control schemes. Discrete fuzzy implementations which store the relational information and set definitions at discrete points have traditionally been used within the control community, whereas continuous fuzzy systems which store and manipulate functional relationships have recently gained in popularity due to their strong links with neural networks. It is shown that when algebraic operators are used to implement the underlying fuzzy logic, a simplified defuzzification calculation can be used in both cases, although the continuous fuzzy systems have a lower computational cost and generally a smoother output surface. Several neurofuzzy training rules are investigated and links are made with standard optimisation algorithms. The merits of adapting weights rather than rule confidences or relational elements are discussed and it is shown to be more efficient to train the neurofuzzy system in weight space. This paper's aim is to present a consistent and computationally efficient approach to implementing neurofuzzy algorithms and to relate it to more conventional systems.

The main objective is to highlight recent efforts to improve (IC) engine fuel efficiency and combustion. Rising fuel prices and stringent emission mandates have demanded cleaner combustion and increased fuel efficiency from the IC engine. This need for increased efficiency has placed compression ignition (CI) engines in the forefront compared to spark ignition (SI) engines. However, the relatively high emission of oxides of nitrogen (NO x ) and particulate matter (PM) emitted by diesel engines increases their cost and raises environmental barriers that have prevented their widespread use in certain markets. The desire to increase IC engine fuel efficiency while simultaneously meeting emissions mandates has thus motivated considerable research. This paper describes recent progress to improve the fuel efficiency of diesel or CI engines through advanced combustion and fuels research. In particular, a dual fuel engine combustion technology called “reactivity controlled compression ignition” (RCCI), which is a variant of Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI), is highlighted, since it provides more efficient control over the combustion process and has the capability to lower fuel use and pollutant emissions. This paper reviews recent RCCI experiments and computational studies performed on light- and heavy-duty engines, and compares results using conventional and alternative fuels (natural gas, ethanol, and biodiesel) with conventional diesel, advanced diesel and HCCI concepts.","the area of high efficiency and clean internal combustion engines.
